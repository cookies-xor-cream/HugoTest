but I don&amp;rsquo;t think that I can wait,
part of me wants to tell you now,
and the other half wants to dodge this fate.
For I doubt that you might feel the same,
but that&amp;rsquo;s okay, an expected sight,
just know, if you ever wish for something more,
that I don&amp;rsquo;t bark, and will never bite.
I&amp;rsquo;ll be your lapdog, you&amp;rsquo;ll have the leash,</description></item><item><title>Hope: Riddled With Holes</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/hope-riddled-with-holes/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/hope-riddled-with-holes/</guid><description>I know that you&amp;rsquo;ve got ahold of a needle,
but don&amp;rsquo;t dare poke holes where my hope stows,
I&amp;rsquo;ve a suicide pact: sealed with a straight shot up,
of an arrow from cupid&amp;rsquo;s stolen bow.
I&amp;rsquo;m short a thimble, my hope wears thin,
don&amp;rsquo;t unthread the loomwork I&amp;rsquo;ve tried
so very hard to diligently spin.</description></item><item><title>I Need A Fallback</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/i-need-a-fallback/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/i-need-a-fallback/</guid><description>I only write when I&amp;rsquo;m mad,
or I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of you,
they&amp;rsquo;re mutually exclusive,
is that too good to be true?
I&amp;rsquo;d like to think that it&amp;rsquo;s not,
but well, what could I know,
if you don&amp;rsquo;t feel how I feel,
then where do I go?</description></item><item><title>I Want To Live A Day In Your Life</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/i-want-to-live-a-day-in-your-life/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/i-want-to-live-a-day-in-your-life/</guid><description>Take me out to where you&amp;rsquo;re at home,
I want a day lived through your sable eyes,
an omen of the fights that we&amp;rsquo;ll one day have,
a forecast with fire in place of ice.
You speed my heart but cool my head,
steady nervous hands trapped in frantic shake,
we&amp;rsquo;ve lightning trapped between our skin,
and we&amp;rsquo;ve got the parts to try to make,
to birth, a monster from our sins.</description></item><item><title>Infatuation: She's My Religion</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/infatuation-shes-my-religion/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/infatuation-shes-my-religion/</guid><description>See the tread of the tracks,
that I leave with my pen,
my heart&amp;rsquo;s changing its tack,
as I neighbour &amp;lsquo;insane&amp;rsquo;.
Don&amp;rsquo;t play with my heart,
I&amp;rsquo;m a sucker for that,
I need a shuffle of tarot,
and you reading my hand.
Instead you&amp;rsquo;re reading my palm,
I think that you&amp;rsquo;ve found,
a mouthful of psalms,
and I long for the sound.</description></item><item><title>Reusable Fuse</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/reusable-fuse/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/reusable-fuse/</guid><description>Can&amp;rsquo;t get anything done,
you&amp;rsquo;re stuck in my head,
can&amp;rsquo;t work with the thought,
so I&amp;rsquo;ll work when I&amp;rsquo;m dead.
Guess that&amp;rsquo;s a fair enough trade,
I&amp;rsquo;ll take it, won&amp;rsquo;t blink,
I can blink in the future,
but now, I can&amp;rsquo;t help but think.
You&amp;rsquo;re a sinkhole of thought,
you&amp;rsquo;re a prion set loose,
you&amp;rsquo;re heating me up,
and burning the fuse.</description></item><item><title>Her Eyes Are Bottomless: I Could Drown...</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/her-eyes-are-bottomless-i-could-drown.../</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/her-eyes-are-bottomless-i-could-drown.../</guid><description>The pins and needles drowned me fast,
the joy was torrenting my heart,
from lungs to pulmonary arteries,
my blood caught air it won&amp;rsquo;t discard.
Coz I&amp;rsquo;m breathing in twice as much,
as I can even try exhale,
it rained on us, but somewhere deep,
my heart was wishing for some hail.
Something to whisk us both away,
to take us from almost alone,
to having more cover than company,</description></item><item><title>You're Where All My Thoughts Used To Be</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/youre-where-all-my-thoughts-used-to-be/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/youre-where-all-my-thoughts-used-to-be/</guid><description>The distance halves every stare I catch,
descending increments in powers of two,
that measure how close my face can get,
before I could finally try reach you.
Like Achilles and the tortoise,
there&amp;rsquo;s infinite time until we touch,
although it fits on a finite clock,
I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m waiting too long; too much.
I&amp;rsquo;m the stroke of a paintbrush,
that can&amp;rsquo;t dry on the paving,
feel like every sentence we swap,</description></item></channel></rss>
