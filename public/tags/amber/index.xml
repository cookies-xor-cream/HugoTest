I could never raise a kid alone,
I know that&amp;rsquo;s something I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t say,
but I&amp;rsquo;ve been humming all her favourite tones&amp;rdquo;.
I told her that she already had,
she shook her head and stroked her palm,
&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s not a dynamic that we should&amp;rsquo;ve had&amp;rdquo;,
and I watched her struggle to stay calm.
&amp;ldquo;I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t say no to seeing,

and a thousand things you can&amp;rsquo;t recall,
are no excuse for you to stall,
give me the keys to the cabinet,
I&amp;rsquo;ll lock up your alcohol.
I find your gaze in eyeless stares,
that then found flight and carried you,
to stories above my newfound glare.
&amp;ldquo;You know it that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t care.&amp;quot;
The difference in the downwards pull,

was the nurses working overtime,
shooting me their side-eyed stared,
as they were pulling out the glass
There was a bottle on the ground,
that was shattered long before,
and the splinters stuck around,
just waiting for the gore.
There were three of them,
and two of you, one of which partook,
because she was the only one,
they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t let off of the hook.</description></item><item><title>Birds Of A Feather: Prelude</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/birds-of-a-feather-prelude/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/birds-of-a-feather-prelude/</guid><description>The last we saw of her that night,
was the cawing and the laughs,
of a cigarette-wielding parrot,
trying to get into her pants
She was a parrot of her love,
she was the reflection found inside,
she was the sad truth that,
she held a mirrors lacking doves.
She was the echoes of her tone,
that reinforced what she thought,
further, forevermore,
a wooden house recast in stone.
And the concrete had to grow its wings,</description></item><item><title>Crazy Talk From XRay Ribs</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/crazy-talk-from-xray-ribs/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/crazy-talk-from-xray-ribs/</guid><description>You came back from the doctor&amp;rsquo;s,

It&amp;rsquo;d been a half year since

when it washed over me,
my ears would stop,
and filter out the noise.
It&amp;rsquo;d been a while since I&amp;rsquo;d been by,
and I can&amp;rsquo;t say that I&amp;rsquo;m happy,
but I can say that I&amp;rsquo;m proud.
There was something in eyes

till it was the passage of time that turned the wine sour.
It takes a stooge of a girl to cupboard it all,

She was missing that day, too sick to get up,
eating spoonfuls of yoghurt, I bet poured by the cup.
And I would go call it cheating, but was wholely convinced,</description></item><item><title>If It Had To Be Somebody's Fault, Wouldn't It Have Been Circumstance's?

That never fluttered, were never heard,
Cycloneborne a stillbirth staccato,
The reaper thought he&amp;rsquo;d take it slow
With you.
Each arythmic draw of summer breath
You feel the hate, like infanticide
But she had chose to meet this fate,
She chose the murder suicide,
Well scratch the murder,
And you&amp;rsquo;d have hurt her,
But she&amp;rsquo;d have killed you,
And that would make it true.
I never knew what to do with her,</description></item><item><title>Iodine Wishes It Were Silicon</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/iodine-wishes-it-were-silicon/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/iodine-wishes-it-were-silicon/</guid><description>She played the part of shards of glass,

in the side that you fell.
You wished with a noose,
so I saw to it well.
And you slipped out your body,
I saw as you slipped.
But you dared to deny me,
as I reached for a sip.
I can hear it all dripping,
