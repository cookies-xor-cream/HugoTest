And a thousand things you can&amp;rsquo;t recall,
Are no excuse for you to stall,
Give me the keys to the cabinet,
I&amp;rsquo;ll lock up your alcohol.
I find your gaze in eyeless stares,
That found flight as they had carried you,
To stories above my newfound glare.
&amp;ldquo;You know it that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t care.&amp;rdquo;
The difference in the downwards pull,
From here and from the earth below,</description></item><item><title>Birds Of A Feather: Postmortem</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/birds-of-a-feather-postmortem/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/birds-of-a-feather-postmortem/</guid><description>The last we saw of her that night,
Was the nurses working overtime,
Shooting me their side-eyed stared,
as they were pulling out the glass
There was a bottle on the ground,
That was shattered long before,
And the splinters stuck around,
Waiting for the gore.
There were three of them,
And two of you, one of which partook,
Because she was the only one,
They wouldn&amp;rsquo;t let off of the hook.</description></item><item><title>Birds Of A Feather: Prelude</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/birds-of-a-feather-prelude/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/birds-of-a-feather-prelude/</guid><description>The last we saw of her that night,
Was the cawing and the laughs,
Of a cigarette-wielding parrot,
trying to get into her pants
She was a parrot of her love,
She was the reflection found inside,
She was the sad truth that,
she held a mirrors without her doves.
She was echoes of of her tone,
That reinforced what she thought,
Further, and forevermore,
A wooden house recast in stone.</description></item><item><title>Crazy Talk From XRay Ribs</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/crazy-talk-from-xray-ribs/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/crazy-talk-from-xray-ribs/</guid><description>You came back from the doctor&amp;rsquo;s,
and the discussions of your bruise,
But he didn&amp;rsquo;t give you any pills,
Why&amp;rsquo;d you mention that you used?
It&amp;rsquo;d been a half year since
shedding x-ray ribs, since the
stitches had been removed.
I mentioned home in passing,
And then you were suggesting
That I moved?</description></item><item><title>Death Is The Cost Of Living</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/death-is-the-cost-of-living/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/death-is-the-cost-of-living/</guid><description>There was something in her voice
When it washed over me,
My ears would stop,
And filter out the noise.
It&amp;rsquo;d been a while since I&amp;rsquo;d been by,
And I can&amp;rsquo;t say that I&amp;rsquo;m happy,
But I can say that I&amp;rsquo;m proud.
There was something in eyes
When it locked with mine,
That killed me slow,
But it made me feel alive.
And I wanna live,
don&amp;rsquo;t just want to</description></item><item><title>Ectoplasmic Automotive Incident: A Posthumous Retrospective</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/ectoplasmic-automotive-incident-a-posthumous-retrospective/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/ectoplasmic-automotive-incident-a-posthumous-retrospective/</guid><description>I may be a half wit
But youre at your at your wits end
Trying to make ends meet ends,
You send for help with no reply
Guess you&amp;rsquo;ll mend this shit alone tonight
I&amp;rsquo;m heavensent, we&amp;rsquo;rr broken
But you&amp;rsquo;re bent by books and pages
That you nicked and have had nooked away,
And postfact claimed that she had lent
Don&amp;rsquo;t lie to me luke your luck ain&amp;rsquo;t spent
This fixation on the truth,</description></item><item><title>Expired Postcard Glue</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/expired-postcard-glue/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/expired-postcard-glue/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;So tell me all the things that you can&amp;rsquo;t be,
Then I&amp;rsquo;ll fill in the vacancies,
The priest goes reads it all out loud,
As we both nod without a sound.
But they&amp;rsquo;re at a wedding with vacant seats,
And each one reads reserved,
Oh I guess that it was meant to be,
And it&amp;rsquo;s what they deserved.
When I got the letter,
Fuck I knew the writing,
Her voice rang loud,</description></item><item><title>From Every Time I Shut My Eyes, Down To Almost Never: Losing Flashbacks To Time</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/from-every-time-i-shut-my-eyes-down-to-almost-never-losing-flashbacks-to-time/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/from-every-time-i-shut-my-eyes-down-to-almost-never-losing-flashbacks-to-time/</guid><description>I know I never wrote back,
But you know what that implies.
You need to stop wrwiting,
To lose the tether; cut the tie.
I&amp;rsquo;m sorry for the lack of distance,
And I&amp;rsquo;m sorry if the distance drags,
I&amp;rsquo;m sorry for the lacked resistance,
And I&amp;rsquo;m sorry for what I let pass.
I&amp;rsquo;ll find you, I have done so twice,
We&amp;rsquo;ll roll the dice and pick the place,
I&amp;rsquo;d call it luck but know too well,</description></item><item><title>I Recycled So Many Memories But You Recycled Christ</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/i-recycled-so-many-memories-but-you-recycled-christ/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/i-recycled-so-many-memories-but-you-recycled-christ/</guid><description>I never realised how much I recycled,
Till it was the passage of time that turned the wine sour.
It takes a stooge of a girl to cupboard it all,
And smash the sacrament wine as she opens the door.
She was missing that day, too sick to get up,
Eating spoonfuls of yoghurt, I bet poured by the cup.
And I would go call it cheating, but was wholely convinced,</description></item><item><title>If It Had To Be Somebody's Fault, Wouldn't It Have Been Circumstance's?

That never fluttered, were never heard,
Cycloneborne a stillbirth staccato,
The reaper thought he&amp;rsquo;d take it slow
With you.
Each arythmic draw of summer breath
You feel the hate, like infanticide
But she had chose to meet this fate,
She chose the murder suicide,
Well scratch the murder,
And you&amp;rsquo;d have hurt her,
But she&amp;rsquo;d have killed you,
And that would make it true.
I never knew what to do with her,</description></item><item><title>Iodine Wishes It Were Silicon</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/iodine-wishes-it-were-silicon/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/iodine-wishes-it-were-silicon/</guid><description>She played the part of shards of glass,
That punctured, fastened, through my hand
You came nursing it with iodine,
Then kissing me with the
Fly screen in between.</description></item><item><title>Ketamine And A Badly Timed Swim (We Fell Off The Fucking Bridge Apparently)</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/ketamine-and-a-badly-timed-swim-we-fell-off-the-fucking-bridge-apparently/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/ketamine-and-a-badly-timed-swim-we-fell-off-the-fucking-bridge-apparently/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m sat by the shore,
On the side that you fell.
You wished with a noose,
So I saw to it well.
And you slipped out your body,
I saw as you slipped.
But you dared to deny me,
As I reached for a sip.
I can hear it all dripping,
As it &amp;lsquo;knocks&amp;rsquo; I suppose.
It came for the throne,
With the old king deposed.
And if you might live,</description></item><item><title>KHoled At Midnight, By The Seaside Mid-River, And Allegedly Dry</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/kholed-at-midnight-by-the-seaside-mid-river-and-allegedly-dry/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/kholed-at-midnight-by-the-seaside-mid-river-and-allegedly-dry/</guid><description>Just tell me how you spiked this cup,
Coz that&amp;rsquo;s an offer that I&amp;rsquo;d take up,
But don&amp;rsquo;t lie to me, I know that look,
Let&amp;rsquo;s just drink it and we&amp;rsquo;ll find a book.
&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s nothing there, there never was
don&amp;rsquo;t overplay it, don&amp;rsquo;t make a fuss&amp;rdquo;,
If I&amp;rsquo;m asleep by Wednesday noon,
the both of us will wake entombed.
&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ve always got to cut a deal,
always find a way to steal,</description></item><item><title>Killing Azrael</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/killing-azrael/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/killing-azrael/</guid><description>I couldn&amp;rsquo;t stop for Azreal to weather burning wings,
And the Muslim in the girl that raised me thinks that that&amp;rsquo;s a sin,
But the both of us know all too well that we&amp;rsquo;re at risk to make the pact,
And likelier than I to play that game and to enact.
She has her lilies and her roses sat in vases all assorted,
Like the symbolism for a life that she couldn&amp;rsquo;t have aborted,</description></item><item><title>Non Spararle</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/non-spararle/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/non-spararle/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know why all this wait,
I feel like we&amp;rsquo;ve stopped crossing fates&amp;rdquo;
And that final line was true:
It spoke of the destiny That we&amp;rsquo;d accrued.
&amp;ldquo;And now was overdue&amp;rdquo;
I could never live with you
&amp;ldquo;And I could never live without&amp;rdquo;
I hope the afterlife can sort this out
&amp;ldquo;Or else I might take a chance,
And end this shit by force tonight&amp;rdquo;
That anachronistic thought
Had echoed in my head,</description></item><item><title>Pascal's Slotmachine</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/pascals-slotmachine/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/pascals-slotmachine/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;If you think about it, think enough,

From girls she shouldn&amp;rsquo;t,
Try so fucking hard to breath.

Shy of rent&amp;rdquo;

I said all that I could wish,

&amp;ldquo;The less you speak the more you write,
But the less you write the less you speak,
If I didn&amp;rsquo;t know any better, I&amp;rsquo;d say by
1994 I would have fucking peaked.
So watch the news, and ink your beak,
I&amp;rsquo;ll write to you, and you&amp;rsquo;ll respond,
So please write back if what you write,
And what you miss just might belong.
