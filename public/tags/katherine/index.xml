Are you ones who fight but fail submit,
Applications with deadlines due.
They&amp;rsquo;d be on time if you are too.
The difference is an hour halved From the Eastern cusp of desert sands
Geotemporal spacetime shifts
Can sunder us with half filled rifts.
We&amp;rsquo;ve got a half an hour come between
The sands and the silica-desert forest screens.</description></item><item><title>Arycyclohexylamine And Diethylamide Salts</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/arycyclohexylamine-and-diethylamide-salts/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/arycyclohexylamine-and-diethylamide-salts/</guid><description>When I cleaned my drawer&amp;rsquo;s shelves,
I&amp;rsquo;d found her old notebook,
I then realised a half-page in,
How her writing must&amp;rsquo;ve looked.
I recognised the words she used,
And the water-damage too,
But she was writing riverside,
By the angel dust and fumes.
You can&amp;rsquo;t trace out any lines,
When the orchid was in bloom,
Of the mixture of an eight-ball ket,
And a quarter-filled balloon.</description></item><item><title>Denial's Inelastic.

To be thinking through the gravity
Of how cut up we got:
Bar the scars and scratches.
I still remember forgetting,
The scenery sliding into a wreckage,
I don&amp;rsquo;t know what car you drove,
But that shit must&amp;rsquo;ve been expensive.
I still forget recalling
All of the shit you took to drive,
And finding it all out after,
But fuck it, you still drove okay.</description></item><item><title>Denial's Inelastic: New Evidence For The Etymology Of Lastique</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/denials-inelastic-new-evidence-for-the-etymology-of-lastique/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/denials-inelastic-new-evidence-for-the-etymology-of-lastique/</guid><description>I sleep with my arms crossed
And my hands entwined,
My ulnar nerve&amp;rsquo;s stretched out
Into a zero width line.
I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t call it elastic,
I don&amp;rsquo;t think that that&amp;rsquo;s quite true,
It&amp;rsquo;s less like the tire off your cars,
And more like the sole of your shoes.
But I say to myself,
Like its vulcanised truth,
That my wrists don&amp;rsquo;t burn,
And my right arm doesn&amp;rsquo;t shoot.
&amp;ldquo;Shooting pain? Ugh,</description></item><item><title>Evergreen Nightmare: Waiting For Magic, But The Magic Is The Waiting</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/evergreen-nightmare-waiting-for-magic-but-the-magic-is-the-waiting/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/evergreen-nightmare-waiting-for-magic-but-the-magic-is-the-waiting/</guid><description>I had a nightmare in a dream, where Evergreen became a tree,
And grew to shelter me.
Well, she&amp;rsquo;s not all she seems, but long lost are these
Remnants of my dreams.
Of all the trees I saw, none bloomed in spring,
To stay through fall.
But if autumn came to steal your shade,
I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t mourn your leaves, my debt&amp;rsquo;s been paid
Though I might seem to grieve our loss,</description></item><item><title>Every Death You Don't See Never Happens</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/every-death-you-dont-see-never-happens/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/every-death-you-dont-see-never-happens/</guid><description>Acuity is now dodging us,
In every form but optical,
The bromine and the dragonfly
They took your sight away.
Leave them here, your sable eyes,
I&amp;rsquo;m waiting by the underpass,
The clock can&amp;rsquo;t tick we froze it&amp;rsquo;s time,
And now its time can&amp;rsquo;t come to pass.
But we&amp;rsquo;re too deep in, we&amp;rsquo;re two deep now,
With two of each, we&amp;rsquo;re asking how,
The four we took have robbed your eyes</description></item><item><title>Geochemistry Of The Western States</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/geochemistry-of-the-western-states/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/geochemistry-of-the-western-states/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m rolled up in their red tape,
And their bullshit policies,
The paranoia that they must take,
And push out onto me.
A corporate bunny roped,
A ropebunny on an underdose,
Prays for knvies as they might hope,
To get cut free and find repose.
In search for the ecology,
Of the ground they&amp;rsquo;ll never dig,
That they will never see,
And never can forgive.
Freedom on this silent hill,</description></item><item><title>I Tried So Hard To Live That I Forgot To Survive</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/i-tried-so-hard-to-live-that-i-forgot-to-survive/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/i-tried-so-hard-to-live-that-i-forgot-to-survive/</guid><description>Water never meant to freeze,
Liquid&amp;rsquo;s ice that gambled feet,
Twenty higher and it would run,
It only needs the naked sun.
To shed its roots and to unplant,
To uproot itself, to take a stand;
It just got lucky, was brought alive,
It aims to live but can&amp;rsquo;t survive.</description></item><item><title>I Wouldn't Recommend Infidelity, Especially If It's Her Doing It</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/i-wouldnt-recommend-infidelity-especially-if-its-her-doing-it/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/i-wouldnt-recommend-infidelity-especially-if-its-her-doing-it/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;If you kill me I won&amp;rsquo;t call it murder,

If I kill you I would call it blood-lust,
But not one that I would grieve.
&amp;ldquo;You have flayed me but don&amp;rsquo;t you stay me,
I&amp;rsquo;ve got less than room for two&amp;rdquo;.
If I knew what I had done then,
You&amp;rsquo;d say that wasn&amp;rsquo;t true.</description></item><item><title>I'm Photosensitive And I Got Swooped</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/im-photosensitive-and-i-got-swooped/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/im-photosensitive-and-i-got-swooped/</guid><description>I think that I
Can&amp;rsquo;t bear to watch
The fabric as it
Comes to tear.
We&amp;rsquo;re always stuck
Just one heart short,
In need of double bit
Support.
The flashing lights
And sudden sounds
Don&amp;rsquo;t rattle me,
My head is sound.
But it&amp;rsquo;s the drinking
That lets me brave,
Through lacked circumstance
That I wholely crave.
Be it crow, or raven,
Or magpie vulture,
I ducked it and I
Flew right under.</description></item><item><title>Les Ã‰chalotes</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/les-%C3%A9chalotes/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/les-%C3%A9chalotes/</guid><description>Fuck, it&amp;rsquo;s like when you&amp;rsquo;d have too much speed,
Can&amp;rsquo;t stay awake but you never caught any sleep,
Whilst our shut-eye stuck and fastened tight
In a one-hour nightmare-dream each night.
And a bullet surely gives a blackened view,
But can you aim the through-and-though?
When love-borne-fear is haunting us, like an Abrahamic truth,
It would sink in that it&amp;rsquo;s permanent:
God I&amp;rsquo;d miss these backlit hues,
But I don&amp;rsquo;t miss the truth.</description></item><item><title>Life Here Is Like Watching The Desert Floor Try To Sew Itself Up</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/life-here-is-like-watching-the-desert-floor-try-to-sew-itself-up/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/life-here-is-like-watching-the-desert-floor-try-to-sew-itself-up/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s the subtle cracks in creviced stone
That&amp;rsquo;s brittle, broken to its core,
That isn&amp;rsquo;t filled, that sits unhoned,
That rids the structure of all its bones.
And all we&amp;rsquo;re left with is the skin,
That&amp;rsquo;s rocky like the desert floor.
That spans the beach unclad with sand,
That has no hands or limbs to grasp.
The desert floor needs and yearns to reach,
both the yarn or thread and the machine,</description></item><item><title>Lighthouse Eyes</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/lighthouse-eyes/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/lighthouse-eyes/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Why me?&amp;rdquo;

Both pale besides,
The flashbang rooms
And neon signs.
I waited out,
I stalled for you,
Then I idled by,
As I missed you.
It was 2 months then,
I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what the
Next month brought,
But I do now.
At least I&amp;rsquo;m alive,
I am alive,
I was alive,
I am alive.</description></item><item><title>Memorypoint: Smokey Oneliners In A Flashbulb Pistol</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/memorypoint-smokey-oneliners-in-a-flashbulb-pistol/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/memorypoint-smokey-oneliners-in-a-flashbulb-pistol/</guid><description>With a shutter snap and full force flash
She flatlined her batteries.
The lithium, it couldn&amp;rsquo;t hold,
The alkali had broke its mould.
A caustic spray of absentees,
That never need RSVP.
The lead paint wore its absence strung
Like fibrosis caught up in her lungs.
We wouldn&amp;rsquo;t miss asbestos words,
The turns of phrase and sharpened tongues.
I was left here, with these memories
That didn&amp;rsquo;t want to plug into the prise.</description></item><item><title>Nevermore Fought Dirty Then Played Her Closing Act: The 2010s In A Post 2016 World</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/nevermore-fought-dirty-then-played-her-closing-act-the-2010s-in-a-post-2016-world/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/nevermore-fought-dirty-then-played-her-closing-act-the-2010s-in-a-post-2016-world/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;re a knifefight in a phonebooth

Or I&amp;rsquo;ll dust them off and break you,
With pocketsand and fistfuls

I just need some space and figure
You might need some more,

To nip the desert heat that bites,
But I bide my time and bid farewell,
And freeze inside the searing glare.
Of all the notions I can&amp;rsquo;t seem sell,
I most of all miss the ice clung air,
The sealess stare of seam-filled rocks,
That lack the water to fill the clocks.
But now I live by seaside straits,
By salty water that solely hates,</description></item><item><title>Red Tape Pollution In Her Time</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/red-tape-pollution-in-her-time/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/red-tape-pollution-in-her-time/</guid><description>So drag me by the wrist,
Then show me all the blue you bleed,
And warn me of the dangers,
But I will never never take your heed.
Cause I&amp;rsquo;m caught between the red tape
Of the path I&amp;rsquo;m on and want to take,
And maybe had you filed it under
Section B I&amp;rsquo;d see.
The filing cab just grew some wings,
So that we could breaks the chains,

Of ambergriss.
And I would cast you out a net,

And I&amp;rsquo;d make sure
That I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t tie it loose.

A finch beak sunders to a solar width,
And demands fish gone, half digested,

Its mouth in place of its money,
And the leck thereof the fish and chips,
Was the reason that its heart was torn.</description></item><item><title>The Cause Of Causality: Ghost On A Boat</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/the-cause-of-causality-ghost-on-a-boat/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/the-cause-of-causality-ghost-on-a-boat/</guid><description>You&amp;rsquo;ve been stunlocked all this time,

In the seamstress
