are you ones who fight but fail submit,
applications with deadlines due.
They&amp;rsquo;d be on time if you are too.
The difference is an hour halved from the Eastern cusp of desert sands.
Geotemporal spacetime shifts
Can sunder us with half filled rifts.
We&amp;rsquo;ve got a half an hour come between
the sands and the silica-desert forest screens.</description></item><item><title>Accidental Lobotomy In The Past In The Future: Retroactive Contraindications</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/accidental-lobotomy-in-the-past-in-the-future-retroactive-contraindications/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/accidental-lobotomy-in-the-past-in-the-future-retroactive-contraindications/</guid><description>I thought she knew I didn&amp;rsquo;t scar,
and in its stead I just bled ichor.
If you wanted to make me bleed,
you&amp;rsquo;d try knifeplay and to slice her.
I wasn&amp;rsquo;t jealous that you got to,
if I had wanted it, I&amp;rsquo;d get it too.
But I&amp;rsquo;m jealous for the reason,
that I wanted me to want it too.
And I used to think about that,
in a time before I&amp;rsquo;d met another.</description></item><item><title>Arycyclohexylamine And Diethylamide Salts</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/arycyclohexylamine-and-diethylamide-salts/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/arycyclohexylamine-and-diethylamide-salts/</guid><description>When I cleaned my drawer&amp;rsquo;s shelves,
I&amp;rsquo;d found her old notebook,
I then realised a half-page in,
how her writing must&amp;rsquo;ve looked.
I recognised the words she used,
and the water-damage too,
but she was writing by the riverside,
by the angel dust and pillared fumes.
You can&amp;rsquo;t trace out any lines,
when the orchid was in bloom,
on the mixture of an eight-ball ket,
and a quarter-filled balloon.</description></item><item><title>Broken Means Broken Until It Doesn't</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/broken-means-broken-until-it-doesnt/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/broken-means-broken-until-it-doesnt/</guid><description>She needed a reason to believe in

And a bullet can grant a blackened view,

The lithium, it couldn&amp;rsquo;t hold,

A caustic spray of absentees,

let my step travel through the clock,
I&amp;rsquo;d take the offer, gladly, promptly,
but I&amp;rsquo;d take it packaged with a glock.
We&amp;rsquo;ve got a target, we&amp;rsquo;ve got a bounty,
we&amp;rsquo;ve got lasersights in stock aplenty,
his name is &amp;lsquo;who I was at sixteen&amp;rsquo; ,
so let&amp;rsquo;s load the thing and we can hunt me.
The world is made of cracks,
and every caveat, and every crevice,</description></item><item><title>The Minute Train: Induction Procedure Context</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/the-minute-train-induction-procedure-context/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/the-minute-train-induction-procedure-context/</guid><description>Consciousness comes once,
and then departs forever,
she forgot her tickets and
the bond of life lay severed.

nameless, brainless, and without body.
My wet tongue scribbled the story of
the continent I share with destiny)
Marg-e ghargh shodan:
Bee esm, o bee zehn, o bee tan.
Zaban-he khees-e man nevesht,
Ghareh-ye man ho sarnevesht.
I&amp;rsquo;m a puddle on the ground,
that conducts no heat,
but carries sound.
She&amp;rsquo;s the solder on my tongue,
that died strung out:
one final rung.
She was the crevice in my heart,</description></item><item><title>The Seamstress' Patchwork Reality</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/the-seamstress-patchwork-reality/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/the-seamstress-patchwork-reality/</guid><description>Tethered, ringing,
broken bones,

And found themselves
lost trapped in dreams,
in the seamstress
and her scenery.</description></item></channel></rss>
