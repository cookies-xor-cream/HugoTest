every sentence I thought to speak
fell in and through the veil of speech
that drove my thoughts and varied ticks.
&amp;ldquo;When&amp;rsquo;d it start?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Think I was six&amp;rdquo;.
&amp;ldquo;And did the anxiolytics help?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;They squashed my thoughts
and my nervous ticks&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;So why claim to me that they did not?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;It helps me in the likeness that
you can come to help someone</description></item><item><title>Broken Means Broken Until It Doesn't</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/broken-means-broken-until-it-doesnt/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/broken-means-broken-until-it-doesnt/</guid><description>She needed a reason to believe in
something past this planet,
but I preferred the notion that
the sky could always shatter.
We&amp;rsquo;ve a glassy floor below
this china ceiling,
and ceramic doesn&amp;rsquo;t
lend so well to healing.
&amp;ldquo;Why do you think that there are stars?
Alien headlights, xenomorphic cars?
I think they&amp;rsquo;re markers for where to dig,
A twinkle for celestial resource rigs&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;I think they&amp;rsquo;re excavated sites,
To show us where&amp;rsquo;s been dug before.</description></item><item><title>Cartopia: Asphalt In Place Of Birds</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/cartopia-asphalt-in-place-of-birds/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/cartopia-asphalt-in-place-of-birds/</guid><description>The dying light of morning stuck,
clung by chilly, smokey air,
and the pigeon/finch soundbite spells,
that died to the highway at 6:00am.
The daylight&amp;rsquo;s breath of car-soaked fumes,
was a single oxide shy of safe,
as each machine layed traffic-queued,
to kill the world and dig its grave anew,
The clearest sight by the streetside view.</description></item><item><title>Death Cab For Cutie's Styrofoam Plates</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/death-cab-for-cuties-styrofoam-plates/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/death-cab-for-cuties-styrofoam-plates/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m par for the course
just as I have been living,
when you spot your own grave
you&amp;rsquo;re a fool to go digging.
So give me a glass,
and we&amp;rsquo;ll fill it with wine,
come pick up a cup and I&amp;rsquo;ll,
flood it with brine.</description></item><item><title>Driving While Eating A Fucking Burger</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/driving-while-eating-a-fucking-burger/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/driving-while-eating-a-fucking-burger/</guid><description>The logistics of an early dinner,
and overbites will find the off-road,
make pedestrians get a splatter slimmer,
bar the casket, I suppose.
Y&amp;rsquo;know you&amp;rsquo;ve got to get some rest,
and you&amp;rsquo;ve got to drive when driving,
you don&amp;rsquo;t stop that when you pass the test,
coz the pedals can be surprising.
Stopping distance is quadratic with your speed,
the fastest lives will crash the hardest,
and rip your heart right off your sleeve,</description></item><item><title>Fourier And The Wavelet Transform</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/fourier-and-the-wavelet-transform/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/fourier-and-the-wavelet-transform/</guid><description>I know the tones that make it up,
that I localise in space or time,
but I lose the fundemental if
I narrow displacement
in the vectorspace.</description></item><item><title>How Can Anyone Sleep When The Night Sky Is A Nail And A Hammer Shy Of Pouring Down On Us?</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/how-can-anyone-sleep-when-the-night-sky-is-a-nail-and-a-hammer-shy-of-pouring-down-on-us/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/how-can-anyone-sleep-when-the-night-sky-is-a-nail-and-a-hammer-shy-of-pouring-down-on-us/</guid><description>The stars are holes
that nails have made.
I&amp;rsquo;m stuck at the door
with knights and knaves.
Pick up the hammer,
and wait your cue,
I&amp;rsquo;ll crack the riddle,
reread the rules.
Orion&amp;rsquo;s a defective set of dots,
its belt pointing out
the structural faults.</description></item><item><title>I Feel The Same (I Just Have Different Motives)</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/i-feel-the-same-i-just-have-different-motives/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/i-feel-the-same-i-just-have-different-motives/</guid><description>If I could move about not spatially,
but through the temporal medium,
I&amp;rsquo;d circumvent the past of me:
I don&amp;rsquo;t wanna meet with them.
Take a calendar, flip the page,
stitch two together, scry the thing,
a half dozen forward, watch me grow,
then go back in time, and I&amp;rsquo;ll rescind.
I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to talk to me,
if I was a half decade out of date,
I recall that the past has bloodlet me,</description></item><item><title>I Tried So Hard To Live That I Forgot To Survive</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/i-tried-so-hard-to-live-that-i-forgot-to-survive/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/i-tried-so-hard-to-live-that-i-forgot-to-survive/</guid><description>Water never meant to freeze,
it&amp;rsquo;s liquid ice that gambled feet,
twenty higher and it would run,
it only needs the naked sun.
To shed its roots and to unplant,
to uproot itself, to take a stand;
it just got lucky, was brought to life,
it aims to live but can&amp;rsquo;t survive.</description></item><item><title>I'm My Own Taylor Series, It's Four Terms Long, Who Am I?</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/im-my-own-taylor-series-its-four-terms-long-who-am-i/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/im-my-own-taylor-series-its-four-terms-long-who-am-i/</guid><description>Theres only so much one can know,
at any given time.
there&amp;rsquo;s a bandwidth and a bitrate,
intrinsic to this rhyme.
You know the momentum or displacement,
of a cubic set of splines.
that trace out with each successive draw,
of breath on their outline.
Was I breathing?
Heard a sigh?
But would you care
to answer why?
My inhale&amp;rsquo;s the diving gradient,
of the monotonic brought sentient,
and I&amp;rsquo;ll be decreasing come the time.</description></item><item><title>I'm Photosensitive And I Got Swooped</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/im-photosensitive-and-i-got-swooped/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/im-photosensitive-and-i-got-swooped/</guid><description>I think that I
can&amp;rsquo;t bear to watch
the fabric as it
comes to tear.
We&amp;rsquo;re always stuck
just one heart short,
in need of double bit
support.
The flashing lights
and sudden sounds
don&amp;rsquo;t rattle me,
my head is sound.
But it&amp;rsquo;s the drinking
that lets me brave,
through lacked circumstances
I wholely crave.
Be it crow, or raven,
or magpie vulture,
I ducked it and I
flew right under.</description></item><item><title>Killing A Puzzle Of A Werewolf</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/killing-a-puzzle-of-a-werewolf/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/killing-a-puzzle-of-a-werewolf/</guid><description>If walking&amp;rsquo;s a silver bullet,
then it&amp;rsquo;s only shooting me dead,
coz the four to eight hours a day that I get,
is only rearranging this puzzle in my head.
I think I&amp;rsquo;m missing a piece,
but the water damage warped,
every piece I tried so hard to place,
pierced through my armour, and my guard.
And maybe with some time,
the colours won&amp;rsquo;t seem as stark,
and instead they&amp;rsquo;ll all gradient together,</description></item><item><title>Laura And Danish Butter Biscuits Couldn't Animate Fire From A Corpse: آتش، کالی</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/laura-and-danish-butter-biscuits-couldnt-animate-fire-from-a-corpse-%D8%A2%D8%AA%D8%B4-%DA%A9%D8%A7%D9%84%DB%8C/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/laura-and-danish-butter-biscuits-couldnt-animate-fire-from-a-corpse-%D8%A2%D8%AA%D8%B4-%DA%A9%D8%A7%D9%84%DB%8C/</guid><description>I pick up every sound I hear,
it distorts and never stays the same,
but it always preserves the fear,
I wish I could tip it over,
I wish I could unhear.
&amp;ldquo;There was a thud and it sticks,
it was loud but so nondescript,
and it buried me in all the sounds
of the shit that came prescript.
And I can&amp;rsquo;t shake off the shudder,
those muffled muted screams,</description></item><item><title>Perpetual Motion Machine</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/perpetual-motion-machine/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/perpetual-motion-machine/</guid><description>If you stop the thing,

lay in silent wait, with idled hands,
watch the skyline and the shifting floor,
turn from silica and to armoured core.
The desert&amp;rsquo;s a single loaded gun,
that&amp;rsquo;s trigger-happy for some fun,
a whirlwind kicks up arid ground,
that aims for eyes, and eyes are found.
Religion&amp;rsquo;s experienced within the wind,
that lets the dust from earth rescind,
if I were to watch the breeze pick up,</description></item><item><title>The Doctor's Office</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/the-doctors-office/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/the-doctors-office/</guid><description>I hate these syllabic ramblings
of these feelgood and these speakfast feelings,
soupy spurs of words spun long
spun till they roll right off your tongue.
They&amp;rsquo;re bled dry, and they are devoid of meaning
and anything vaguely human-seeming,
what in heaven&amp;rsquo;s name is the obsession?
Hey doc, I&amp;rsquo;m done, let&amp;rsquo;s call this session!</description></item><item><title>The Four Types Of Nostalgia: Why Did I Try To Preserve The Timeline?</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/the-four-types-of-nostalgia-why-did-i-try-to-preserve-the-timeline/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/the-four-types-of-nostalgia-why-did-i-try-to-preserve-the-timeline/</guid><description>The first is misery, that&amp;rsquo;s found fermented,
it tinges sweet but with acetic hues,
you somehow miss the caustic burn,
even when remembering equates to self-abuse.
The second is a remembrance prayer,
you know only blurs of truths raced past,
They meet the sky and fizzle thin,
you lost the metal, but kept the cast.
The third one is a vacant feeling,
where you try it, but with quicksand rules,</description></item><item><title>The Infinitive Of Melding</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/the-infinitive-of-melding/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/the-infinitive-of-melding/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m stuttering at every
stumble of a thought,
those that I have Lost,
and Those I Never Found.
I doll, and sit, and wait at last,
just gotta string on one more day,
with the chatter and my idle words
of this sated clapping trap.
Hear me out, then question me,
a keynote on the rest of it,
floating on the restless sea,
of work and meaning that I
never could&amp;rsquo;ve knit.</description></item><item><title>Wait Right Here Mr Nosebleed: I'll Run Home For Some Pads</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/wait-right-here-mr-nosebleed-ill-run-home-for-some-pads/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/wait-right-here-mr-nosebleed-ill-run-home-for-some-pads/</guid><description>You traded buckshots for a fawn,
and the straightest, fastest crawl,
to get me pads for my nosebleed,
halfway through our forage for the dawn.
Coz I&amp;rsquo;ve bloodied my own face,
the thinking made it spurt in spades,
and I know that I&amp;rsquo;m not keeping up your pace,
but I&amp;rsquo;ll be halfway down the road,
burning out the stopwatch for this race.
You know this shit isn&amp;rsquo;t a sprint,
and you don&amp;rsquo;t have to tire feet,</description></item><item><title>Xanthile Hydration: Underdosing Insectiside</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/xanthile-hydration-underdosing-insectiside/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/xanthile-hydration-underdosing-insectiside/</guid><description>Coffee, coffe, on the wall,
could I be the most cafeinated
of them all?
Know I&amp;rsquo;m not running on empty,
but on two hours oblivion,
and the promise of 10 bucks caffeine.
and as far as this week goes,
that&amp;rsquo;s alright with me.
At least when I woke up today,
I was only just barely dizzy.
and if you really got to know me,
you&amp;rsquo;d know that&amp;rsquo;s the best that</description></item></channel></rss>
