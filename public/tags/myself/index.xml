Sanity Is A Place Between Stuttering And Forgetting</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/anxiolytics-sanity-is-a-place-between-stuttering-and-forgetting/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/anxiolytics-sanity-is-a-place-between-stuttering-and-forgetting/</guid><description>They robbed my heartrate and my words
Every sentence I thought to speak
Fell in and through the veil of speech
That drove my thoughts and varied ticks
&amp;ldquo;When&amp;rsquo;d it start?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Think I was six&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;And did the anxiolytics help?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;They squashed my thoughts
And my nervous ticks&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;So why claim to me that they did not?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;It helps me in the likeness that
You can come to help someone</description></item><item><title>Cartopia: Asphalt In Place Of Birds</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/cartopia-asphalt-in-place-of-birds/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/cartopia-asphalt-in-place-of-birds/</guid><description>The dying light of morning stuck,
Clung by chilly, smoky air,
And the pigeon and finch soundbite spells,
That died to the highway at 6am.
The daylight&amp;rsquo;s breath of car-soaked fumes,
Was a single oxide shy of safe,
As each machine layed traffic-queued,
To kill the world and dig its grave anew,
The clearest sight in the streetside view.</description></item><item><title>Death Cab For Cutie's Styrofoam Plates</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/death-cab-for-cuties-styrofoam-plates/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/death-cab-for-cuties-styrofoam-plates/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m par for the course
Just as I have been living,
When you spot your own grave
You&amp;rsquo;re a fool to go digging.
So give me a glass,
And we&amp;rsquo;ll fill it with wine,
Come pick up a cup and I&amp;rsquo;ll,
Flood it with brine.</description></item><item><title>Driving While Eating A Fucking Burger</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/driving-while-eating-a-fucking-burger/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/driving-while-eating-a-fucking-burger/</guid><description>The logistics of an early dinner,
And overbites will find the off-road,
Make pedestrians get a splatter slimmer,
Bar the casket, I suppose.
Y&amp;rsquo;know you&amp;rsquo;ve got to get some rest,
And you&amp;rsquo;ve got to drive when driving,
You don&amp;rsquo;t stop that when you pass the test,
Coz the pedals can be surprising.
Stopping distance is quadratic with your speed,
The fastest lives will crash the hardest,
And rip your heart right off your sleeve,</description></item><item><title>I'm My Own Taylor Series, It's Four Terms Long, Who Am I?</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/im-my-own-taylor-series-its-four-terms-long-who-am-i/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/im-my-own-taylor-series-its-four-terms-long-who-am-i/</guid><description>Theres only so much one can know,
At any given time.
There&amp;rsquo;s a bandwidth and a bitrate,
Intrinsic to this rhyme.
You know the momentum or displacement,
Of a cubic set of splines.
That trace out with each successive draw,
Of breath on their outline.
Was I breathing?
Heard a sigh?
But would you care
To answer why?
My inhale&amp;rsquo;s the diving gradient,
Of the monotonic brought sentient,
And I&amp;rsquo;ll be decreasing come the time.</description></item><item><title>Laura And Danish Butter Biscuits Couldn't Animate Fire From A Corpse: آتش، کالی</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/laura-and-danish-butter-biscuits-couldnt-animate-fire-from-a-corpse-%D8%A2%D8%AA%D8%B4-%DA%A9%D8%A7%D9%84%DB%8C/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/laura-and-danish-butter-biscuits-couldnt-animate-fire-from-a-corpse-%D8%A2%D8%AA%D8%B4-%DA%A9%D8%A7%D9%84%DB%8C/</guid><description>I pick up every sound I hear,
It distorts and never stays the same,
But it always preserves the fear,
I wish I could tip it over,
I wish I could unhear.
&amp;ldquo;There was a thud and it sticks,
It was loud but so nondescript,
And it buried me in all the sounds
Of the shit I got prescript.
And I can&amp;rsquo;t shake off the shudder,
Those muffled muted screams,</description></item><item><title>The Four Types Of Nostalgia: Why Did I Try To Preserve The Timeline?</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/the-four-types-of-nostalgia-why-did-i-try-to-preserve-the-timeline/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/the-four-types-of-nostalgia-why-did-i-try-to-preserve-the-timeline/</guid><description>The first is misery, that&amp;rsquo;s found fermented,
It tinges sweet but with acetic hues,
You somehow miss the caustic burn,
Even when remembering equates to self-abuse.
The second is a remembrance prayer,
You know only blurs of truths raced past,
They meet the sky and fizzle thin,
You lost the metal, but kept the cast.
The third one is a vacant feeling,
Where you try it, but with quicksand rules,</description></item><item><title>The Infinitive Of Melding</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/the-infinitive-of-melding/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/the-infinitive-of-melding/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m stuttering at every
Stumble of a thought,
Those I Lost,
And Those I Never Found.
I doll and sit and wait at last,
Just gotta string on one more day,
With the chatter and my idle words
Of my sated clapping trap.
Hear me out, then question me,
A keynote on the rest of it,
Floating on the restless sea,
Of work and meaning that I
Never knit.
Work&amp;rsquo;s almost over, I&amp;rsquo;m due a break,</description></item></channel></rss>
