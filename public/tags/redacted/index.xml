of a hyperinflated heartrate seething.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a drag of a day, but that&amp;rsquo;s half okay,
I made it with friends, and that feels good to say.
It cut the thinking, and cut the running,
of the stream across my face.
Of the red that meant to find my nose,
but found itself downwardly displaced,
and gravity-disposed.
My vision chose to split in twine,</description></item><item><title>Anything That Isn't Nothing Isn't Worth Anything Right Now</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/anything-that-isnt-nothing-isnt-worth-anything-right-now/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/anything-that-isnt-nothing-isnt-worth-anything-right-now/</guid><description>You think that thinking&amp;rsquo;s a valid way,
to logic out the shit you&amp;rsquo;d say.
But time is the slowest, strongest grinder,
the coffee-from-mountains-and-trauma-finder,
the accumulation of beans in fire.
You didn&amp;rsquo;t even have the drink,
you only breathed the citric dust,
and that&amp;rsquo;s a promise you won&amp;rsquo;t keep.
But you know that you should wear a mask,
though you can&amp;rsquo;t be fussed or bothered so.
So you gargle-blood the night away,</description></item><item><title>Autoionisation: Sitting Still Is The Isoelectric Point</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/autoionisation-sitting-still-is-the-isoelectric-point/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/autoionisation-sitting-still-is-the-isoelectric-point/</guid><description>If the air around me was solid,
you&amp;rsquo;d see the claw marks digging through,
from out my body and into some
liminal space slightly closer to you.
If you had thermal vision,
you&amp;rsquo;d see the heat as it fizzled,
out from microscopic tremors,
Streaming to steam out the drizzle.
If you had barometer nerves,
you&amp;rsquo;d see the pressure as it climbs,
from kPa to atmospheres,
like a meteorological crime.
If you had gold foil to crack,</description></item><item><title>Glowing Skeletal Fluorescence</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/glowing-skeletal-fluorescence/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/glowing-skeletal-fluorescence/</guid><description>Fluorescence and phosphorescence,
are my skeleton&amp;rsquo;s iridescent,
but hers is dull and grainy,
the bone has lost its sheen firmly.
I hope she&amp;rsquo;s still glowing in UV or IR
I would hate to watch the shimmer fade
You can pick up the phone,
or could hang up infused,
by the rage of my match
that ran down your fuse.
I know you&amp;rsquo;re a halide away,
from being coupled and paired,</description></item><item><title>Love's Thermal Vampirism</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/loves-thermal-vampirism/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/loves-thermal-vampirism/</guid><description>There&amp;rsquo;s an absence in the heat,
that I don&amp;rsquo;t feel inside the cold.
Like its shattering my teeth,
like it bites into my bones.
And the winter here is far too cold,
is something that I&amp;rsquo;m often told.
But the winter here is far too short,
leaving six months for the summer scorch.
Its like I&amp;rsquo;m watching a burning live,
seems I&amp;rsquo;m fever-struck for all my life.
And I don&amp;rsquo;t know what fish I&amp;rsquo;ll reel,</description></item><item><title>Mute By Way Of Birthday Cake (Amongst Other Things)</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/mute-by-way-of-birthday-cake-amongst-other-things/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/mute-by-way-of-birthday-cake-amongst-other-things/</guid><description>I threw up all my words last night,
gonna take a little break,
guess that I won&amp;rsquo;t write.
Think I&amp;rsquo;ve exhumed the static confluence,
breathed out the poison with its essence.
If I couldn&amp;rsquo;t pry my mouth to talk,
then I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even have to try,
but I have to find a way to walk
from my door to bed tonight.
Slept harder and better,
than all fucking week.

where&amp;rsquo;s the blood: I&amp;rsquo;m curious,
has it been rained on and been rinsed,
from seven to one past twelve.
My sheets are soaked.
My shirt is soaked.
The tissues ran out,
now they&amp;rsquo;re all soaked.
My bloody nose,
knows no remorse,
it just keeps pumping,
to juxtapose
this image of my tearless eyes
with the painted face, but you might find,
it didn&amp;rsquo;t time the thing quite right.</description></item><item><title>Old Timey Projectors With Little Joy Stamped On The Film</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/old-timey-projectors-with-little-joy-stamped-on-the-film/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/old-timey-projectors-with-little-joy-stamped-on-the-film/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a year or two, spent with a corpse,
that would always be rotting, but never decompose,
we pumped its body full of formaldehyde,
so the storm of maggots wouldn&amp;rsquo;t pierce its hide.
I blurred away the past week or two,
was confused with not much else to do,
but bask in the mindset that I left me in,
stuck in a highlight reel that couldn&amp;rsquo;t spin.</description></item><item><title>One Of Those Missiles Pilotted By A Pigeon, Heading Straight Into The Ocean: Choice In Theory Doesn't Mean Freedom In Practice</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/one-of-those-missiles-pilotted-by-a-pigeon-heading-straight-into-the-ocean-choice-in-theory-doesnt-mean-freedom-in-practice/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/one-of-those-missiles-pilotted-by-a-pigeon-heading-straight-into-the-ocean-choice-in-theory-doesnt-mean-freedom-in-practice/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s funny how I &amp;ldquo;rehash these things&amp;rdquo;,
when I lack the beak for proper speech,
I&amp;rsquo;m eating the words I meant to speak,
a missile birdless, that never seeks.
I&amp;rsquo;m sorry, I know, I&amp;rsquo;m a bag of bricks,
but you know the saying of stones and sticks,
we gutted us, then set us free,
but all we tasted was salty seas.</description></item><item><title>Pen And Paper And ER Nosebleeds: ???</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/pen-and-paper-and-er-nosebleeds/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/pen-and-paper-and-er-nosebleeds/</guid><description>Tactile braille and a crayon smudge,
an ink-blood splatter with pencil-lines,
to gorge the caustic sludge.
Like the smear of the jet,
but in its textual form,
of a torrent of question marks
in which she was born.

to nip the desert heat that bites,
but I bide my time and bid farewell,
and freeze inside the searing glare.
Of all the notions I can&amp;rsquo;t seem sell,
I most of all miss the ice clung air,
the sealess stare of seam-filled rocks,
that lack the water to fill their clocks.
But now I live by seaside straits,
by salty water that solely hates,</description></item><item><title>The Hex Of Vexing: Cursing, Then Pausing</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/the-hex-of-vexing-cursing-then-pausing/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/the-hex-of-vexing-cursing-then-pausing/</guid><description>The pension of recrudescence,
like an inelastic tension strings
us along with its bitter essence:
through the ashy, sour tinge.
What&amp;rsquo;s the escape velocity,
to reach the land and forest fire,
to escape this stormy sea,
that can&amp;rsquo;t seem to drown our pyre?
Tell me where, and I&amp;rsquo;ll choose when,
we&amp;rsquo;ll find the dragon slumber-phased,
singe the scales shed from disdain,
to break us out of this smokey haze.</description></item><item><title>The Pirate Caught Me Curbing: Pretty Faes Mid-Sprint And Awake</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/the-pirate-caught-me-curbing-pretty-faes-mid-sprint-and-awake/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/the-pirate-caught-me-curbing-pretty-faes-mid-sprint-and-awake/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ll mark my path
and then I&amp;rsquo;ll hound,
I&amp;rsquo;ll snake the words
when they are found.
Think of words I waste
but seldom breathe, then
bleed the whiskey&amp;rsquo;s taste
till it secedes.
There&amp;rsquo;s a thousand things
I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t say,
and even more
I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t think.
But I&amp;rsquo;m treading ground
and marking seas,
on broken boats
that slowly sink.
And if you find
my dying light:
just bid farewell
please say goodnight.</description></item><item><title>Time Is Medicine, But She Has Contraindications</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/time-is-medicine-but-she-has-contraindications/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/time-is-medicine-but-she-has-contraindications/</guid><description>She talked to me,
but I was just talking to the wine.
I was treading carpet,
but she was drawing sandy lines.
I was quiet,
and she was just looking for a fight.
She was fishing me,
and when I saw the bait,
I decided that I&amp;rsquo;ll bite.</description></item></channel></rss>
