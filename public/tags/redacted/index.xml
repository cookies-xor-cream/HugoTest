Of a hyperinflated heartrate seething.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a drag of a day, but that&amp;rsquo;s half okay,
I made it with friends, and that feels good to say.
It cut the thinking, and cut the running,
Of the stream across my face.
Of the red that meant to find my nose,
But found itself downwardly displaced,
and gravity-disposed.
My vision chose to split in twine,</description></item><item><title>Anything That Isn't Nothing Isn't Worth Anything Right Now</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/anything-that-isnt-nothing-isnt-worth-anything-right-now/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/anything-that-isnt-nothing-isnt-worth-anything-right-now/</guid><description>You think that thinking&amp;rsquo;s a valid way,
To logic out the shit you&amp;rsquo;d say.
But time is the slowest, strongest grinder,
The coffee-from-mountains-and-trauma-finder,
The accumulation keeps you up at night.
You didn&amp;rsquo;t even have the drink,
You only breathed the citric dust,
And that&amp;rsquo;s a promise you won&amp;rsquo;t keep.
But you know that you should wear a mask,
Though you can&amp;rsquo;t be fussed or bothered so.
So you gargle-blood the night away,</description></item><item><title>Conviction On A Whim: The GenZ Playbook</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/conviction-on-a-whim-the-genz-playbook/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/conviction-on-a-whim-the-genz-playbook/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;d make you unhand the phone,
But you&amp;rsquo;re glued to the screen,
As if it keeps you alive,
Like nothing I have ever seen.
Drowning in the backlight,
As you try to not decide,
Is it worth it or is it not
To give the slightest shit about.</description></item><item><title>Fly Higher, I'd Like To See A Comet.</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/fly-higher-id-like-to-see-a-comet./</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/fly-higher-id-like-to-see-a-comet./</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s fucking weird that I can&amp;rsquo;t breath,
What&amp;rsquo;s that saying that she used?
Every time that we fall asleep,
We wake up more confused?
Between the coughing fits
And the wearing down of us,
We have a while to go
And here I am waiting on the bus.
Like all that I recall
Is all I have forgot,
Like this blackhole of a life
Is all I&amp;rsquo;ve begot.
The days all rot and blend,</description></item><item><title>Love's Thermal Vampirism</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/loves-thermal-vampirism/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/loves-thermal-vampirism/</guid><description>There&amp;rsquo;s an absence in the heat,
That I don&amp;rsquo;t feel inside the cold.
Like its shattering my teeth,
Like it bites into my bones.
And the winter here is far too cold,
Is something that I&amp;rsquo;m often told.
But the winter here is far too short,
Leaving six months for the summer scorch.
Its like I&amp;rsquo;m watching a burning live,
Seems I&amp;rsquo;m fever-struck for all my life.
And I don&amp;rsquo;t know what fish I&amp;rsquo;ll reel,</description></item><item><title>Mute By Way Of Birthday Cake (Amongst Other Things)</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/mute-by-way-of-birthday-cake-amongst-other-things/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/mute-by-way-of-birthday-cake-amongst-other-things/</guid><description>I threw up all my words last night,
Gonna take a little break,
guess that I won&amp;rsquo;t write.
Think I&amp;rsquo;ve exhumed the static confluence,
Breathed out the poison with its essence.
If I couldn&amp;rsquo;t pry my mouth to talk,
Then I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even have to try,
But I have to find a way to walk
From my door to bed tonight.
Slept harder and better,
Than all fucking week.
Time and its passage</description></item><item><title>Nosebleed: The First Night Is The Easiest</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/nosebleed-the-first-night-is-the-easiest/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/nosebleed-the-first-night-is-the-easiest/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a half a dozen hours since,
Where&amp;rsquo;s the blood: I&amp;rsquo;m curious,
Has it been rained on and been rinsed,
From seven to one past twelve.
My sheets are soaked.
My shirt is soaked.
The tissues ran out,
Now they&amp;rsquo;re all soaked.
My bloody nose,
Knows no remorse,
It just keeps pumping,
To juxtapose
This image of my tearless eyes
With the painted face, but you might find,
It didn&amp;rsquo;t time the thing quite right.</description></item><item><title>Pen And Paper And ER Nosebleeds: ???</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/pen-and-paper-and-er-nosebleeds/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/pen-and-paper-and-er-nosebleeds/</guid><description>Tactile braille and a crayon smudge,
An ink-blood splatter with pencil-lines,
To gorge the caustic sludge.
Like the smear of the jett,
But in its textual form,
Of a torrent of question marks,
In which she was born.

And then I&amp;rsquo;ll hound,
I&amp;rsquo;ll snake the words
When they are found.
Think of words I waste
But seldom breathe, then
Bleed the whiskey&amp;rsquo;s taste
Till it secedes.
There&amp;rsquo;s a thousand things
I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t say,
And even more
I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t think.
But I&amp;rsquo;m treading ground
And marking seas,
On broken boats
That slowly sink.
And if you find
My dying light:
Just bid farewell
Please say goodnight.</description></item></channel></rss>
