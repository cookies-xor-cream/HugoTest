with his dart-set and a map,
and he can&amp;rsquo;t rest until he&amp;rsquo;s cursed,
and he&amp;rsquo;s made her feel like crap.
But he cauterized the damage caused,
when the wounds he stuck had lit aflame,
and couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but take a pause,
and find a second cause to place the blame.
And I can&amp;rsquo;t complain, I should (I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t quite try to) do,
but I&amp;rsquo;m burnt out whole, gone through and through,</description></item><item><title>Conviction On A Whim: The GenZ Playbook</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/conviction-on-a-whim-the-genz-playbook/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/conviction-on-a-whim-the-genz-playbook/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;d make you unhand the phone,
but you&amp;rsquo;re glued to the screen,
as if it keeps you alive,
like nothing I have ever seen.
Drowning in the backlight,
as you try to not decide,
is it worth it or is it not
to give the slightest shit about.</description></item><item><title>Fly Higher, I'd Like To See A Comet.</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/fly-higher-id-like-to-see-a-comet./</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/fly-higher-id-like-to-see-a-comet./</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s fucking weird that I can&amp;rsquo;t breath,
what&amp;rsquo;s that saying that she used?
every time we fall asleep,
we wake up more confused?
Between the coughing fits
and the wearing down of us,
we have a while to go
and here I am waiting on the bus.
Like all that I recall
is all I have forgot,
like this blackhole of a life
is all I&amp;rsquo;ve begot.
The days all rot and blend,</description></item><item><title>Geochemistry Of The Western States</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/geochemistry-of-the-western-states/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/geochemistry-of-the-western-states/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m rolled up in their red tape,
and their bullshit policies,
the paranoia that they must take,
and push out onto me.
A corporate bunny roped,
a ropebunny on an underdose,
prays for knvies as they might hope,
to get cut free and find repose.
In search for the ecology,
of the ground they&amp;rsquo;ll never dig,
that they will never see,
and never can forgive.
Freedom on this silent hill,</description></item><item><title>Leaning Too Close Wasn't Close Enough</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/leaning-too-close-wasnt-close-enough/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/leaning-too-close-wasnt-close-enough/</guid><description>Her face felt like snow against mine,
and the frost kept me in place,
like I was frozen in time.
And I thought that she&amp;rsquo;d know,
that I was chronically warm,
but if she chills out my bones,
then what is the harm?</description></item><item><title>Terrifying Pescatarian Munchkin</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/terrifying-pescatarian-munchkin/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/terrifying-pescatarian-munchkin/</guid><description>The fish and chips were stale ingested,
a finch beak sunders to a solar width,
and demands fish gone, half digested,
it screamed and it wailed but it never bit.
And bit by bit my stomach turned,
birds scare me but this one wore
its mouth in place of its money,
and the lack thereof the fish and chips,
Wws the reason that its heart was torn.</description></item></channel></rss>
