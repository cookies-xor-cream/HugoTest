and thank god, it was looking bleak.
I get to extinguish these napalm hands,
for the remainder of this week.
The lowered gaze and mumbled words,
suggested that the fire might&amp;rsquo;ve spread,
and my arms are numb now but still in tact
and the pain&amp;rsquo;s found second wind in my head.
I got an MRI scheduled this month,
and I hope I can trap the panic inside,</description></item><item><title>Don't Be Hungover</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/dont-be-hungover/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/dont-be-hungover/</guid><description>If we retroactively cut the drinking,
would this ship we never built,
unwind the clock and stop its sinking?
I&amp;rsquo;m busy with the bottom of this bottle,
it&amp;rsquo;s marked with an ex that I need to reach,
so load the nitrous and blast the throttle.
we&amp;rsquo;re halfway out the breach.</description></item><item><title>Egg Mayo Sandwich And Grenwich Mean Time: Scotland's Too Far Sweetheart</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/egg-mayo-sandwich-and-grenwich-mean-time-scotlands-too-far-sweetheart/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/egg-mayo-sandwich-and-grenwich-mean-time-scotlands-too-far-sweetheart/</guid><description>I want a routine, I want a set of steps,
but I won&amp;rsquo;t meet you for a second time.
Please don&amp;rsquo;t apologise, you didn&amp;rsquo;t overstep,
I&amp;rsquo;m just cycling between the states of matter,
and I need to take my time.
I swear to you I&amp;rsquo;m fine,
but tonight I&amp;rsquo;m looking for a name,
that&amp;rsquo;s spelt any way but &amp;lsquo;mine&amp;rsquo;.</description></item><item><title>Giving Up Means Meeting Halfway In Space And Halfway In Time</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/giving-up-means-meeting-halfway-in-space-and-halfway-in-time/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/giving-up-means-meeting-halfway-in-space-and-halfway-in-time/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;ve got a minute and an hour hand,
but I need to count the seconds down,
till I shake the spin and try to stand,
and accustom to these vacant frowns.
Please stop festering the asking,
please stop playing these games,
I&amp;rsquo;m not looking for some tempest,
that&amp;rsquo;s going to need to be tamed.
For future reference,
pick your answers from this list:
Vacant,

in this tectonic ocean,
where the plates glide, and bump,
till they&amp;rsquo;re all disheveled,
in one big lump.
I&amp;rsquo;m stuck in a benzedrine daydream,
and I drank the sky wonky tonight,
but this slope has got me,
standing still like I&amp;rsquo;m still level
enough to fight.
Your window&amp;rsquo;s looking pretty,
but it&amp;rsquo;s stuck caught tangled up,
in fly screens, oh, what a waste,
of the pretty and the gorgeous bevel,</description></item><item><title>I Would've Liked To Like Hazel Auburn, But Don't (And Never Will)</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/i-wouldve-liked-to-like-hazel-auburn-but-dont-and-never-will/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/i-wouldve-liked-to-like-hazel-auburn-but-dont-and-never-will/</guid><description>She&amp;rsquo;s got auburn hair and hazel eyes,
I bet a pretty name, but wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know,
namelessness is her disguise,
what it is, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have a clue.
The inheritance of the nothing,
is waking up with her Toyota&amp;rsquo;s keys,
and the subtle nervous stuck-fast sting,
of a nail in my head that&amp;rsquo;s not far enough in.
Tighten the screws, get me a nailgun,
I&amp;rsquo;m not looking for a string of accidents,</description></item><item><title>Minute Eater: They Need More Lights At The Park</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/minute-eater-they-need-more-lights-at-the-park/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/minute-eater-they-need-more-lights-at-the-park/</guid><description>You wore a sorry smile,
with face eclipsed,
by a phantom kiss,
that you barely missed.
You burned your time,
then cracked your wrists,
and crossed my name,
off from this list.
With questions found,
but no answers fixed,
the nightmares stung,
like a needle pricks.</description></item><item><title>Pyroclastic Flow At Point Blank</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/pyroclastic-flow-at-point-blank/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/pyroclastic-flow-at-point-blank/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m soul-deep steeped in suffering,
that&amp;rsquo;s where my darkest humour lives,
hiding in the paragraphs, and curt remarks,
that are my filter and my sieve.
Coz pain without the irony,
is nothing more than pain.
just a senseless, wanton violence,
with no comedy to gain.
The one thing that might dull the pain,
converges on the one thing that I lack,
the panicked public breath attack in a
not so subtle, nervous fade to black.</description></item><item><title>The Crow Always Flies The Same Straight Line That I Just Happened To Drown</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/the-crow-always-flies-the-same-straight-line-that-i-just-happened-to-drown/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/the-crow-always-flies-the-same-straight-line-that-i-just-happened-to-drown/</guid><description>One night worth of zopiclone,
is all I need to reset me,
as the crow flies, or will have flown,
my sleep requires a parted sea.</description></item><item><title>The Epicentre Of A Shock-Induced Spasms (Magnitude 9 On The Richter Scale)</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/the-epicentre-of-a-shock-induced-spasms-magnitude-9-on-the-richter-scale/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/the-epicentre-of-a-shock-induced-spasms-magnitude-9-on-the-richter-scale/</guid><description>My jaw decided to wire shut,
and I tried to tell you &amp;lsquo;no&amp;rsquo;,
but I&amp;rsquo;ve never wore such a heavy maw,
so I lost the volume when I said &amp;lsquo;go&amp;rsquo;.
I&amp;rsquo;m sorry that my grip had stuck,
but I&amp;rsquo;m just happy it was weak.
You held my hand as it had struck,
the napalm hit its peak.
I can&amp;rsquo;t feel my fingers now,
and I can&amp;rsquo;t seem to find my tongue,</description></item></channel></rss>
