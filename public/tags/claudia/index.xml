Are from bloodshot eyes who do not care.
Can we turn back time to plant a seed,
And trap an oracle inside that tree?
It&amp;rsquo;ll put the hindsight in the foresight,
Of my -7 strong smeared blind spot eyesight.
But I&amp;rsquo;ll steal the eyes from in the bark,
And cast the truth out through this farce.
I went too far, was brash not bold,</description></item><item><title>Coin Flip Of An Exit Plan: Barbed Wire On A Slamming Door</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/coin-flip-of-an-exit-plan-barbed-wire-on-a-slamming-door/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/coin-flip-of-an-exit-plan-barbed-wire-on-a-slamming-door/</guid><description>She&amp;rsquo;s the corpus of a spirit,
She&amp;rsquo;s a smear of the past,
She&amp;rsquo;s a hollow shell of
What she inherits at last.
She&amp;rsquo;s the lack of a battle,
She&amp;rsquo;s the chorus reversed,
She&amp;rsquo;s the carapace of
The finish to a quieter verse.
She&amp;rsquo;s my pinch on her chin,
She&amp;rsquo;s a record stood still,
I think that that&amp;rsquo;s fine
But I wish she would spin.
She&amp;rsquo;s a 10 minute walk,
She&amp;rsquo;s a flower in wilt,</description></item><item><title>Jackson Avenue: I Hated Who I Was At 16</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/jackson-avenue-i-hated-who-i-was-at-16/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/jackson-avenue-i-hated-who-i-was-at-16/</guid><description>I always borrow tempered time,
Devoid of anchored stopping-signs,
I seldom stop for tempo&amp;rsquo;d brace,
And speak with blood drawn to my face.
I found a park with tapered sound,
I walked straight through the thorny greens,
My feet then met this cockroach&amp;rsquo;d ground,
My vocal chords in likeness seamed.
Scream,
Or don&amp;rsquo;t,
There&amp;rsquo;s no one there.
Wail,
Or don&amp;rsquo;t,
Just rid this air.
Breathe,
Or don&amp;rsquo;t,
There&amp;rsquo;s better things.</description></item><item><title>Mandibles-Eyes: Stepping Over An Arthropod</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/mandibles-eyes-stepping-over-an-arthropod/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/mandibles-eyes-stepping-over-an-arthropod/</guid><description>Frosted glass and broken windows,
The barking on the midnight walk,
Has nothing left to show me now,
And I&amp;rsquo;ve nowhere left to go.
Was on Ullapool and Bombard,
Things were said but not by me,
And I&amp;rsquo;m making my life hard now,
And you think that I don&amp;rsquo;t see?
He begged me: &amp;ldquo;stay home&amp;rdquo;,
But I&amp;rsquo;m deaf on the right,
I gotta get off the phone,
Coz I&amp;rsquo;m catching a ride.</description></item><item><title>Murder At The Nursery: When Death Preempts Living</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/murder-at-the-nursery-when-death-preempts-living/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/murder-at-the-nursery-when-death-preempts-living/</guid><description>I said hi to you in passing,
On a day in the dead of summer,
Record it by the sweat I wore
Remembered by the heatwave&amp;rsquo;s strokes.
You said hi back, a sleight of tongue?
Is this a lapse in judgement spied?
I said hi, and then hello again,
You said it back and I knew then.
That my friend was dead.
Hello, orphan,
Hello again.</description></item><item><title>Mutilating My Cadaver: Ghūl-e Biābān</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/mutilating-my-cadaver-gh%C5%ABl-e-bi%C4%81b%C4%81n/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/mutilating-my-cadaver-gh%C5%ABl-e-bi%C4%81b%C4%81n/</guid><description>Every breath I took today,
Is stunted slightly lighter,
Than every death I&amp;rsquo;ve
Long since lived past.
She dismantled tombs
That we had laid,
Then a second one
Found the coffins.
And she undid the nails.
I hammered them with teeth,
But she found the time to softly speak,
To tell me that I must see breath,
To tell me I need sorely breathe.
She didn&amp;rsquo;t have the right,
To pull my fangs,</description></item><item><title>Pending Atomic Transaction During An Application Of Bayes' Rule</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/pending-atomic-transaction-during-an-application-of-bayes-rule/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/pending-atomic-transaction-during-an-application-of-bayes-rule/</guid><description>Bayes would kill me or hand a trophy
If he saw how I had used his rule.
The instant I know something new,
Is the instant I don&amp;rsquo;t think it through.
What I&amp;rsquo;m doing&amp;rsquo;s a discontinuous function,
Of all the shit that&amp;rsquo;s been done before.
And I&amp;rsquo;ve indexed you but weighted time,
So much more than I did before.</description></item><item><title>The Same Option Twice: Asking For A Second Is Allegedly Overindulgent</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/the-same-option-twice-asking-for-a-second-is-allegedly-overindulgent/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/the-same-option-twice-asking-for-a-second-is-allegedly-overindulgent/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m caught between charybdis and Scylla.
I&amp;rsquo;m coiled between a serpent and a snake.
She held my hand as if to ask me,
Which of these one decisions I would make.
I&amp;rsquo;m caught by tassels serpentine,
I&amp;rsquo;m coiled between a serpent and a snake.
The scarlet is wrapping around me,
And it tells me that it&amp;rsquo;s only for my sake
But you have lived here so much longer
In the same time that I haven&amp;rsquo;t got to live.</description></item><item><title>Ullapool And Bombard: Karma Means Defanging Myself</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/ullapool-and-bombard-karma-means-defanging-myself/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/ullapool-and-bombard-karma-means-defanging-myself/</guid><description>Keep me breathing,
I&amp;rsquo;ll live with heaving,
I don&amp;rsquo;t hate you,
I&amp;rsquo;m only grieving.
Thanks for all
The breath I drew,
And with each one
I had thought of you.
And thought that I
Should forget about
The nowheres and
The roundabout.
You knew, coz I told
You every week.
But you say you didn&amp;rsquo;t,
Now I can&amp;rsquo;t speak.
But that&amp;rsquo;s old news,
I know it is.
I left you clues.</description></item><item><title>Unpublished Obituary Of A Living Girl: Received By 7 With An Hour Delay</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/unpublished-obituary-of-a-living-girl-received-by-7-with-an-hour-delay/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/unpublished-obituary-of-a-living-girl-received-by-7-with-an-hour-delay/</guid><description>Funny number, please riddle me,
Not with words but with heavy lead.
Did you eat nine or devour him?
Punishment for the life he lead.
Funny girl go, watch bleed him dry,
Watch the red wash into the sky.
See the colour coagulate,
Then gate-keep both your collective fate.
Everything is worse when it&amp;rsquo;s seven.
Everything is worse when it&amp;rsquo;s overdue.
I wrote us this postmortem,
I&amp;rsquo;ll let tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s papers read it for you.</description></item></channel></rss>
