I&amp;rsquo;d get a wishing well to wish you to this room,
coz I&amp;rsquo;ve got scrawlings fading, and they&amp;rsquo;re peppering my walls,
the only religion stood against the haunts in this old hall.
Hear me, listen, please, interpolate my words,
fuck the stones, just grab a shotgun, we&amp;rsquo;ve got ammo,
and we&amp;rsquo;ve got to make sure that the both of us are heard,</description></item><item><title>Paused On Overdrive: The Repeater Clipped Your Screams And Never Heard Your Whispers</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/paused-on-overdrive-the-repeater-clipped-your-screams-and-never-heard-your-whispers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/paused-on-overdrive-the-repeater-clipped-your-screams-and-never-heard-your-whispers/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve got a canker sore now,
from taking your call,
and who&amp;rsquo;s to hear this old tree,
if it shrivels and falls.
Will you pick up in the morning?
I&amp;rsquo;ve got a class before noon,
or will we shut the fuck up,
and parcel this gloom?
I long for a century ago,
coz the telephone lines,
though they&amp;rsquo;d give it a go,
wouldn&amp;rsquo;t carry your cries.
They&amp;rsquo;d die and allay,</description></item><item><title>Time Is A Rift To Purgatory</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/time-is-a-rift-to-purgatory/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/time-is-a-rift-to-purgatory/</guid><description>Go and call me a saint,
but I&amp;rsquo;d be betting I&amp;rsquo;m not,
are these compliments all
the stock that you&amp;rsquo;ve got?
Sorry you were falling in love,
but I was falling straight out,
is the ocean between,
all the distance we&amp;rsquo;ve got?</description></item></channel></rss>
