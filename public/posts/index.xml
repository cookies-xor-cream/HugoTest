Of a hyperinflated heartrate seething.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a drag of a day, but that&amp;rsquo;s half okay,
I made it with friends, and that feels good to say.
It cut the thinking, and cut the running,
Of the stream across my face.
Of the red that meant to find my nose,
But found itself downwardly displaced,
and gravity-disposed.
My vision chose to split in twine,</description></item><item><title>A 9:30 Start Is 90 Minutes Lost To Timezones</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/a-930-start-is-90-minutes-lost-to-timezones/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/a-930-start-is-90-minutes-lost-to-timezones/</guid><description>Butterflies with tattered wings
Are you ones who fight but fail submit,
Applications with deadlines due.
They&amp;rsquo;d be on time if you are too.
The difference is an hour halved From the Eastern cusp of desert sands
Geotemporal spacetime shifts
Can sunder us with half filled rifts.
We&amp;rsquo;ve got a half an hour come between
The sands and the silica-desert forest screens.</description></item><item><title>Anxiolytics:

Every sentence I thought to speak
Fell in and through the veil of speech
That drove my thoughts and varied ticks
&amp;ldquo;When&amp;rsquo;d it start?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Think I was six&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;And did the anxiolytics help?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;They squashed my thoughts
And my nervous ticks&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;So why claim to me that they did not?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;It helps me in the likeness that

To logic out the shit you&amp;rsquo;d say.
But time is the slowest, strongest grinder,
The coffee-from-mountains-and-trauma-finder,
The accumulation keeps you up at night.
You didn&amp;rsquo;t even have the drink,
You only breathed the citric dust,
And that&amp;rsquo;s a promise you won&amp;rsquo;t keep.
But you know that you should wear a mask,
Though you can&amp;rsquo;t be fussed or bothered so.
So you gargle-blood the night away,</description></item><item><title>Arycyclohexylamine And Diethylamide Salts</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/arycyclohexylamine-and-diethylamide-salts/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/arycyclohexylamine-and-diethylamide-salts/</guid><description>When I cleaned my drawer&amp;rsquo;s shelves,
I&amp;rsquo;d found her old notebook,
I then realised a half-page in,
How her writing must&amp;rsquo;ve looked.
I recognised the words she used,
And the water-damage too,
But she was writing riverside,
By the angel dust and fumes.
You can&amp;rsquo;t trace out any lines,
When the orchid was in bloom,
Of the mixture of an eight-ball ket,
And a quarter-filled balloon.</description></item><item><title>Birds Of A Feather: Mise En Quoi</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/birds-of-a-feather-mise-en-quoi/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/birds-of-a-feather-mise-en-quoi/</guid><description>The blood, and crying,
And a thousand things you can&amp;rsquo;t recall,
Are no excuse for you to stall,
Give me the keys to the cabinet,
I&amp;rsquo;ll lock up your alcohol.
I find your gaze in eyeless stares,
That found flight as they had carried you,
To stories above my newfound glare.
&amp;ldquo;You know it that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t care.&amp;rdquo;
The difference in the downwards pull,
From here and from the earth below,</description></item><item><title>Birds Of A Feather: Postmortem</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/birds-of-a-feather-postmortem/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/birds-of-a-feather-postmortem/</guid><description>The last we saw of her that night,
Was the nurses working overtime,
Shooting me their side-eyed stared,
as they were pulling out the glass
There was a bottle on the ground,
That was shattered long before,
And the splinters stuck around,
Waiting for the gore.
There were three of them,
And two of you, one of which partook,
Because she was the only one,
They wouldn&amp;rsquo;t let off of the hook.</description></item><item><title>Birds Of A Feather: Prelude</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/birds-of-a-feather-prelude/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/birds-of-a-feather-prelude/</guid><description>The last we saw of her that night,
Was the cawing and the laughs,
Of a cigarette-wielding parrot,
trying to get into her pants
She was a parrot of her love,
She was the reflection found inside,
She was the sad truth that,
she held a mirrors without her doves.
She was echoes of of her tone,
That reinforced what she thought,
Further, and forevermore,
A wooden house recast in stone.</description></item><item><title>Blind Strangers Gambling At The Existential Casino</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/blind-strangers-gambling-at-the-existential-casino/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/blind-strangers-gambling-at-the-existential-casino/</guid><description>Your steely guards and glassy stares,
Are from bloodshot eyes who do not care.
Can we turn back time to plant a seed,
And trap an oracle inside that tree?
It&amp;rsquo;ll put the hindsight in the foresight,
Of my -7 strong smeared blind spot eyesight.
But I&amp;rsquo;ll steal the eyes from in the bark,
And cast the truth out through this farce.
I went too far, was brash not bold,</description></item><item><title>Cartopia: Asphalt In Place Of Birds</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/cartopia-asphalt-in-place-of-birds/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/cartopia-asphalt-in-place-of-birds/</guid><description>The dying light of morning stuck,
Clung by chilly, smoky air,
And the pigeon and finch soundbite spells,
That died to the highway at 6am.
The daylight&amp;rsquo;s breath of car-soaked fumes,
Was a single oxide shy of safe,
As each machine layed traffic-queued,
To kill the world and dig its grave anew,
The clearest sight in the streetside view.</description></item><item><title>Casual Racism: Coda For The Winterscape Of Maternity Leave Ending</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/casual-racism-coda-for-the-winterscape-of-maternity-leave-ending/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/casual-racism-coda-for-the-winterscape-of-maternity-leave-ending/</guid><description>He&amp;rsquo;s out here playing &amp;lsquo;conjure slurs&amp;rsquo;,
With his dart-set and a map,
And he can&amp;rsquo;t quite rest until he&amp;rsquo;s cursed,
And he&amp;rsquo;s made her feel like crap.
But he cauterized the damage caused,
When the wounds he stuck had lit aflame,
And he couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but take a pause,
And find a second cause to place the blame.
And I can&amp;rsquo;t complain, I should (I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t quite try to) do,</description></item><item><title>Coin Flip Of An Exit Plan: Barbed Wire On A Slamming Door</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/coin-flip-of-an-exit-plan-barbed-wire-on-a-slamming-door/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/coin-flip-of-an-exit-plan-barbed-wire-on-a-slamming-door/</guid><description>She&amp;rsquo;s the corpus of a spirit,
She&amp;rsquo;s a smear of the past,
She&amp;rsquo;s a hollow shell of
What she inherits at last.
She&amp;rsquo;s the lack of a battle,
She&amp;rsquo;s the chorus reversed,
She&amp;rsquo;s the carapace of
The finish to a quieter verse.
She&amp;rsquo;s my pinch on her chin,
She&amp;rsquo;s a record stood still,
I think that that&amp;rsquo;s fine
But I wish she would spin.
She&amp;rsquo;s a 10 minute walk,
She&amp;rsquo;s a flower in wilt,</description></item><item><title>Conviction On A Whim: The GenZ Playbook</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/conviction-on-a-whim-the-genz-playbook/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/conviction-on-a-whim-the-genz-playbook/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;d make you unhand the phone,
But you&amp;rsquo;re glued to the screen,
As if it keeps you alive,
Like nothing I have ever seen.
Drowning in the backlight,
As you try to not decide,
Is it worth it or is it not
To give the slightest shit about.</description></item><item><title>Crazy Talk From XRay Ribs</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/crazy-talk-from-xray-ribs/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/crazy-talk-from-xray-ribs/</guid><description>You came back from the doctor&amp;rsquo;s,
and the discussions of your bruise,
But he didn&amp;rsquo;t give you any pills,
Why&amp;rsquo;d you mention that you used?
It&amp;rsquo;d been a half year since
shedding x-ray ribs, since the
stitches had been removed.
I mentioned home in passing,
And then you were suggesting
That I moved?</description></item><item><title>Death Cab For Cutie's Styrofoam Plates</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/death-cab-for-cuties-styrofoam-plates/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/death-cab-for-cuties-styrofoam-plates/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m par for the course
Just as I have been living,
When you spot your own grave
You&amp;rsquo;re a fool to go digging.
So give me a glass,
And we&amp;rsquo;ll fill it with wine,
Come pick up a cup and I&amp;rsquo;ll,
Flood it with brine.</description></item><item><title>Death Is The Cost Of Living</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/death-is-the-cost-of-living/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/death-is-the-cost-of-living/</guid><description>There was something in her voice
When it washed over me,
My ears would stop,
And filter out the noise.
It&amp;rsquo;d been a while since I&amp;rsquo;d been by,
And I can&amp;rsquo;t say that I&amp;rsquo;m happy,
But I can say that I&amp;rsquo;m proud.
There was something in eyes
When it locked with mine,
That killed me slow,
But it made me feel alive.
And I wanna live,
don&amp;rsquo;t just want to</description></item><item><title>Denial's Inelastic.

To be thinking through the gravity
Of how cut up we got:
Bar the scars and scratches.
I still remember forgetting,
The scenery sliding into a wreckage,
I don&amp;rsquo;t know what car you drove,
But that shit must&amp;rsquo;ve been expensive.
I still forget recalling
All of the shit you took to drive,
And finding it all out after,
But fuck it, you still drove okay.</description></item><item><title>Denial's Inelastic: New Evidence For The Etymology Of Lastique</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/denials-inelastic-new-evidence-for-the-etymology-of-lastique/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/denials-inelastic-new-evidence-for-the-etymology-of-lastique/</guid><description>I sleep with my arms crossed
And my hands entwined,
My ulnar nerve&amp;rsquo;s stretched out
Into a zero width line.
I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t call it elastic,
I don&amp;rsquo;t think that that&amp;rsquo;s quite true,
It&amp;rsquo;s less like the tire off your cars,
And more like the sole of your shoes.
But I say to myself,
Like its vulcanised truth,
That my wrists don&amp;rsquo;t burn,
And my right arm doesn&amp;rsquo;t shoot.
&amp;ldquo;Shooting pain?

And overbites will find the off-road,
Make pedestrians get a splatter slimmer,
Bar the casket, I suppose.
Y&amp;rsquo;know you&amp;rsquo;ve got to get some rest,
And you&amp;rsquo;ve got to drive when driving,
You don&amp;rsquo;t stop that when you pass the test,
Coz the pedals can be surprising.
Stopping distance is quadratic with your speed,
The fastest lives will crash the hardest,
And rip your heart right off your sleeve,</description></item><item><title>Ectoplasmic Automotive Incident: A Posthumous Retrospective</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/ectoplasmic-automotive-incident-a-posthumous-retrospective/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/ectoplasmic-automotive-incident-a-posthumous-retrospective/</guid><description>I may be a half wit

And grew to shelter me.
Well, she&amp;rsquo;s not all she seems, but long lost are these
Remnants of my dreams.
Of all the trees I saw, none bloomed in spring,
To stay through fall.
But if autumn came to steal your shade,
I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t mourn your leaves, my debt&amp;rsquo;s been paid

To get cut free and find repose.
In search for the ecology,
Of the ground they&amp;rsquo;ll never dig,
That they will never see,

Eating spoonfuls of yoghurt, I bet poured by the cup.

It aims to live but can&amp;rsquo;t survive.</description></item><item><title>I Wouldn't Recommend Infidelity, Especially If It's Her Doing It</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/i-wouldnt-recommend-infidelity-especially-if-its-her-doing-it/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/i-wouldnt-recommend-infidelity-especially-if-its-her-doing-it/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;If you kill me I won&amp;rsquo;t call it murder,

There&amp;rsquo;s a bandwidth and a bitrate,
Intrinsic to this rhyme.
You know the momentum or displacement,
Of a cubic set of splines.

Of breath on their outline.

But would you care
To answer why?

That I wholely crave.
Be it crow, or raven,
Or magpie vulture,

The reaper thought he&amp;rsquo;d take it slow

But she had chose to meet this fate,
She chose the murder suicide,
Well scratch the murder,
And you&amp;rsquo;d have hurt her,
But she&amp;rsquo;d have killed you,
And that would make it true.

And bit by bit my stomach turned,
Birds scare me but this one wore
Its mouth in place of its money,
And the leck thereof the fish and chips,
Was the reason that its heart was torn.</description></item><item><title>The Cause Of Causality: Ghost On A Boat</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/the-cause-of-causality-ghost-on-a-boat/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/the-cause-of-causality-ghost-on-a-boat/</guid><description>You&amp;rsquo;ve been stunlocked all this time,
By the pictures that we took of her,
I&amp;rsquo;d like to think that I&amp;rsquo;m smarter,
Coz I gave mine all away.
She always had blood run between
The length of her, down from her jeans
And it reached up to her ghost white tees
and ran the toll of lengthened sleeves.
And honestly if I described
The clothes she wore or how she walked:</description></item><item><title>The Doctor's Office</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/the-doctors-office/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/the-doctors-office/</guid><description>I hate these syllabic ramblings
Of these feelgood and these speakfast feelings,
Soupy spurs of words spun long
Spun till they roll right off your tongue.
They&amp;rsquo;re bled dry, and they are devoid of meaning
And anything vaguely human-seeming,
What in heaven&amp;rsquo;s name is the obsession?
Hey doc, I&amp;rsquo;m done, let&amp;rsquo;s call this session!</description></item><item><title>The Four Types Of Nostalgia: Why Did I Try To Preserve The Timeline?</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/the-four-types-of-nostalgia-why-did-i-try-to-preserve-the-timeline/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/the-four-types-of-nostalgia-why-did-i-try-to-preserve-the-timeline/</guid><description>The first is misery, that&amp;rsquo;s found fermented,
It tinges sweet but with acetic hues,
You somehow miss the caustic burn,
Even when remembering equates to self-abuse.
The second is a remembrance prayer,
You know only blurs of truths raced past,
They meet the sky and fizzle thin,
You lost the metal, but kept the cast.
The third one is a vacant feeling,
Where you try it, but with quicksand rules,</description></item><item><title>The Iberian Peninsula: What The Fuck Were You Thinking With That Age Gap

&amp;ldquo;The less you speak the more you write,
But the less you write the less you speak,
If I didn&amp;rsquo;t know any better, I&amp;rsquo;d say by
1994 I would have fucking peaked.
So watch the news, and ink your beak,
I&amp;rsquo;ll write to you, and you&amp;rsquo;ll respond,
So please write back if what you write,
And what you miss just might belong.

Stumble of a thought,
Those I Lost,
And Those I Never Found.
I doll and sit and wait at last,
Just gotta string on one more day,
With the chatter and my idle words
Of my sated clapping trap.
Hear me out, then question me,
A keynote on the rest of it,
Floating on the restless sea,
Of work and meaning that I
Never knit.
Work&amp;rsquo;s almost over, I&amp;rsquo;m due a break,</description></item><item><title>The KK Thesis 2: Disproof Of The Disproof.

And then I&amp;rsquo;ll hound,
I&amp;rsquo;ll snake the words
When they are found.
Think of words I waste
But seldom breathe, then
Bleed the whiskey&amp;rsquo;s taste
Till it secedes.
There&amp;rsquo;s a thousand things
I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t say,
And even more
I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t think.
But I&amp;rsquo;m treading ground
And marking seas,
On broken boats
That slowly sink.
And if you find
My dying light:
Just bid farewell
Please say goodnight.</description></item><item><title>The Same Option Twice: Asking For A Second Is Allegedly Overindulgent</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/the-same-option-twice-asking-for-a-second-is-allegedly-overindulgent/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/the-same-option-twice-asking-for-a-second-is-allegedly-overindulgent/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m caught between charybdis and Scylla.
I&amp;rsquo;m coiled between a serpent and a snake.
She held my hand as if to ask me,
Which of these one decisions I would make.
I&amp;rsquo;m caught by tassels serpentine,
I&amp;rsquo;m coiled between a serpent and a snake.
The scarlet is wrapping around me,
And it tells me that it&amp;rsquo;s only for my sake
But you have lived here so much longer
In the same time that I haven&amp;rsquo;t got to live.</description></item><item><title>The Seamstress' Patchwork Reality</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/the-seamstress-patchwork-reality/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/the-seamstress-patchwork-reality/</guid><description>Tethered, ringing,
Broken bones,
Each had sound
Their hollow tone.
Lead&amp;rsquo;s the servant,
Of these observant,
Eyes that fled,
The ghastly seams.
And found themselves
Lost trapped in dreams,
In the seamstress
And her scenery.</description></item><item><title>Travesty Is Circumstance Gone Genetic: Her Nightmares Stayed Longer Than Mine</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/travesty-is-circumstance-gone-genetic-her-nightmares-stayed-longer-than-mine/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/travesty-is-circumstance-gone-genetic-her-nightmares-stayed-longer-than-mine/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;You have a one track mind,
Is how I&amp;rsquo;d put it I suppose.
You didn&amp;rsquo;t change and never had,
So grab a drink and place it in my hand.&amp;rdquo;
When she asked me I then shot a look,
And I wish that that was all it took

And I never even got to deliver.
Wasted time and effort spent,
But I&amp;rsquo;m not broken, I&amp;rsquo;m only bent.</description></item><item><title>Ullapool And Bombard: Karma Means Defanging Myself</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/ullapool-and-bombard-karma-means-defanging-myself/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/ullapool-and-bombard-karma-means-defanging-myself/</guid><description>Keep me breathing,
I&amp;rsquo;ll live with heaving,
I don&amp;rsquo;t hate you,
I&amp;rsquo;m only grieving.
Thanks for all
The breath I drew,
And with each one
I had thought of you.
And thought that I
Should forget about
The nowheres and
The roundabout.
You knew, coz I told
You every week.
But you say you didn&amp;rsquo;t,
Now I can&amp;rsquo;t speak.
But that&amp;rsquo;s old news,
I know it is.
I left you clues.</description></item><item><title>Unpublished Obituary Of A Living Girl: Received By 7 With An Hour Delay</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/unpublished-obituary-of-a-living-girl-received-by-7-with-an-hour-delay/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/Hugo/poems/unpublished-obituary-of-a-living-girl-received-by-7-with-an-hour-delay/</guid><description>Funny number, please riddle me,
Not with words but with heavy lead.
Did you eat nine or devour him?
Punishment for the life he lead.
Funny girl go, watch bleed him dry,
Watch the red wash into the sky.
See the colour coagulate,
Then gate-keep both your collective fate.
Everything is worse when it&amp;rsquo;s seven.
Everything is worse when it&amp;rsquo;s overdue.
I wrote us this postmortem,
I&amp;rsquo;ll let tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s papers read it for you.</description></item></channel></rss>
