of a hyperinflated heartrate seething.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a drag of a day, but that&amp;rsquo;s half okay,
I made it with friends, and that feels good to say.
It cut the thinking, and cut the running,
of the stream across my face.
Of the red that meant to find my nose,
but found itself downwardly displaced,
and gravity-disposed.
My vision chose to split in twine,</description></item><item><title>A 9:30 Start Is 90 Minutes Lost To Timezones</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/a-930-start-is-90-minutes-lost-to-timezones/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/a-930-start-is-90-minutes-lost-to-timezones/</guid><description>Butterflies with tattered wings
are you ones who fight but fail submit,
applications with deadlines due.
They&amp;rsquo;d be on time if you are too.
The difference is an hour halved from the Eastern cusp of desert sands.
Geotemporal spacetime shifts
Can sunder us with half filled rifts.
We&amp;rsquo;ve got a half an hour come between
the sands and the silica-desert forest screens.</description></item><item><title>A Month's Vacation For The Austroasiatic Plates</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/a-months-vacation-for-the-austroasiatic-plates/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/a-months-vacation-for-the-austroasiatic-plates/</guid><description>A trip to the ER got me what I needed,
and thank god, it was looking bleak.
I get to extinguish these napalm hands,
for the remainder of this week.
The lowered gaze and mumbled words,
suggested that the fire might&amp;rsquo;ve spread,
and my arms are numb now but still in tact
and the pain&amp;rsquo;s found second wind in my head.
I got an MRI scheduled this month,
and I hope I can trap the panic inside,</description></item><item><title>A Mother Briefly, Or Never At All?</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/a-mother-briefly-or-never-at-all/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/a-mother-briefly-or-never-at-all/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Should I be glad it went this way?
I could never raise a kid alone,
I know that&amp;rsquo;s something I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t say,
but I&amp;rsquo;ve been humming all her favourite tones&amp;rdquo;.
I told her that she already had,
she shook her head and stroked her palm,
&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s not a dynamic that we should&amp;rsquo;ve had&amp;rdquo;,
and I watched her struggle to stay calm.
&amp;ldquo;I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t say no to seeing,

and in its stead I just bled ichor.
If you wanted to make me bleed,
you&amp;rsquo;d try knifeplay and to slice her.
I wasn&amp;rsquo;t jealous that you got to,
if I had wanted it, I&amp;rsquo;d get it too.
But I&amp;rsquo;m jealous for the reason,
that I wanted me to want it too.
And I used to think about that,
in a time before I&amp;rsquo;d met another.</description></item><item><title>Anxiolytics:

every sentence I thought to speak
fell in and through the veil of speech
that drove my thoughts and varied ticks.
&amp;ldquo;When&amp;rsquo;d it start?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Think I was six&amp;rdquo;.
&amp;ldquo;And did the anxiolytics help?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;They squashed my thoughts

to logic out the shit you&amp;rsquo;d say.
But time is the slowest, strongest grinder,
the coffee-from-mountains-and-trauma-finder,
the accumulation of beans in fire.
You didn&amp;rsquo;t even have the drink,
you only breathed the citric dust,
and that&amp;rsquo;s a promise you won&amp;rsquo;t keep.
But you know that you should wear a mask,
though you can&amp;rsquo;t be fussed or bothered so.
So you gargle-blood the night away,</description></item><item><title>Arycyclohexylamine And Diethylamide Salts</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/arycyclohexylamine-and-diethylamide-salts/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/arycyclohexylamine-and-diethylamide-salts/</guid><description>When I cleaned my drawer&amp;rsquo;s shelves,
I&amp;rsquo;d found her old notebook,
I then realised a half-page in,
how her writing must&amp;rsquo;ve looked.
I recognised the words she used,
and the water-damage too,
but she was writing by the riverside,
by the angel dust and pillared fumes.
You can&amp;rsquo;t trace out any lines,
when the orchid was in bloom,
on the mixture of an eight-ball ket,
and a quarter-filled balloon.</description></item><item><title>Autoionisation: Sitting Still Is The Isoelectric Point</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/autoionisation-sitting-still-is-the-isoelectric-point/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/autoionisation-sitting-still-is-the-isoelectric-point/</guid><description>If the air around me was solid,
you&amp;rsquo;d see the claw marks digging through,
from out my body and into some
liminal space slightly closer to you.
If you had thermal vision,
you&amp;rsquo;d see the heat as it fizzled,
out from microscopic tremors,
Streaming to steam out the drizzle.
If you had barometer nerves,
you&amp;rsquo;d see the pressure as it climbs,
from kPa to atmospheres,
like a meteorological crime.
If you had gold foil to crack,</description></item><item><title>Birds Of A Feather: Mise En Quoi</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/birds-of-a-feather-mise-en-quoi/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/birds-of-a-feather-mise-en-quoi/</guid><description>The blood, and crying,
and a thousand things you can&amp;rsquo;t recall,
are no excuse for you to stall,
give me the keys to the cabinet,
I&amp;rsquo;ll lock up your alcohol.
I find your gaze in eyeless stares,
that then found flight and carried you,
to stories above my newfound glare.
&amp;ldquo;You know it that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t care.&amp;quot;
The difference in the downwards pull,
from here and from the earth below,</description></item><item><title>Birds Of A Feather: Postmortem</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/birds-of-a-feather-postmortem/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/birds-of-a-feather-postmortem/</guid><description>The last we saw of her that night,
was the nurses working overtime,
shooting me their side-eyed stared,
as they were pulling out the glass
There was a bottle on the ground,
that was shattered long before,
and the splinters stuck around,
just waiting for the gore.
There were three of them,
and two of you, one of which partook,
because she was the only one,
they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t let off of the hook.</description></item><item><title>Birds Of A Feather: Prelude</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/birds-of-a-feather-prelude/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/birds-of-a-feather-prelude/</guid><description>The last we saw of her that night,
was the cawing and the laughs,
of a cigarette-wielding parrot,
trying to get into her pants
She was a parrot of her love,
she was the reflection found inside,
she was the sad truth that,
she held a mirrors lacking doves.
She was the echoes of her tone,
that reinforced what she thought,
further, forevermore,
a wooden house recast in stone.
And the concrete had to grow its wings,</description></item><item><title>Blind Strangers Gambling At The Existential Casino</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/blind-strangers-gambling-at-the-existential-casino/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/blind-strangers-gambling-at-the-existential-casino/</guid><description>Your steely guards and glassy stares,
are from bloodshot eyes who do not care.
Can we turn back time to plant a seed,
and trap an oracle inside that tree?
It&amp;rsquo;ll put the hindsight in the foresight,
of my minus seven strong smeared blind spot eyesight.
But I&amp;rsquo;ll steal the eyes from in the bark,
and cast the truth out through this farce.
I went too far, was brash not bold,</description></item><item><title>Broken Means Broken Until It Doesn't</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/broken-means-broken-until-it-doesnt/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/broken-means-broken-until-it-doesnt/</guid><description>She needed a reason to believe in
something past this planet,
but I preferred the notion that
the sky could always shatter.
We&amp;rsquo;ve a glassy floor below
this china ceiling,
and ceramic doesn&amp;rsquo;t
lend so well to healing.
&amp;ldquo;Why do you think that there are stars?
Alien headlights, xenomorphic cars?
I think they&amp;rsquo;re markers for where to dig,
A twinkle for celestial resource rigs&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;I think they&amp;rsquo;re excavated sites,
To show us where&amp;rsquo;s been dug before.</description></item><item><title>Can't Stomach The Body Or Thr Drink: Won't You Mix Something Sweeter, Honey</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/cant-stomach-the-body-or-thr-drink-wont-you-mix-something-sweeter-honey/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/cant-stomach-the-body-or-thr-drink-wont-you-mix-something-sweeter-honey/</guid><description>Come add your poison to this brew,

I&amp;rsquo;ll clue you in and strap the seat,

clung by chilly, smokey air,
and the pigeon/finch soundbite spells,
that died to the highway at 6:00am.
The daylight&amp;rsquo;s breath of car-soaked fumes,
was a single oxide shy of safe,
as each machine layed traffic-queued,
to kill the world and dig its grave anew,
The clearest sight by the streetside view.</description></item><item><title>Casual Racism: Coda For The Winterscape Of Maternity Leave Ending</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/casual-racism-coda-for-the-winterscape-of-maternity-leave-ending/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/casual-racism-coda-for-the-winterscape-of-maternity-leave-ending/</guid><description>He&amp;rsquo;s out here playing &amp;lsquo;conjure slurs&amp;rsquo;,

But he cauterized the damage caused,
when the wounds he stuck had lit aflame,
and couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but take a pause,
and find a second cause to place the blame.
And I can&amp;rsquo;t complain, I should (I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t quite try to) do,

she&amp;rsquo;s a smear of the past,
she&amp;rsquo;s a hollow shell of
what she inherits at last.
She&amp;rsquo;s the lack of a battle,
she&amp;rsquo;s the chorus reversed,
she&amp;rsquo;s the carapace of
the finish to a quieter verse.
She&amp;rsquo;s my pinch on her chin,
she&amp;rsquo;s a record stood still,
I think that that&amp;rsquo;s fine
but I wish she would spin.
She&amp;rsquo;s a 10 minute walk,
she&amp;rsquo;s a flower in wilt,</description></item><item><title>Conviction On A Whim: The GenZ Playbook</title><link>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/conviction-on-a-whim-the-genz-playbook/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cookies-xor-cream.github.io/crappy-amateur-poetry/poems/conviction-on-a-whim-the-genz-playbook/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;d make you unhand the phone,

when it washed over me,

It&amp;rsquo;d been a while since I&amp;rsquo;d been by,
