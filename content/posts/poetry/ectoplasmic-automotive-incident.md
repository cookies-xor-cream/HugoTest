I may be a half wit  
but youre at your at your wits end  
trying to make ends meet ends,  
you send for help with no reply  
guess you'll mend this shit alone tonight.

I'm heavensent, we're broken  
but you're bent by books and pages  
that you nicked and have had nooked away,  
and postfact claimed that she had lent  
don't lie to me luke your luck ain't spent.

This fixation on the truth,  
like an ambidextrous scream,  
screens out the words that you might mean  
from those that truth would  
never have dared seen.

I mean,  
if you catch my drift.

but ghosts pass through cars, don't they?
