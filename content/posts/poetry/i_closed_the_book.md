You said it'd get worse before it can get better,  
so then why's it been all uphill for me from here?  
I think I paid off the separation in installments,  
I was clearing the debt while we were wasting time on each other.

And I've been wherever the peace is for at least a fortnight long,  
I've found the words I wanted securely stapled to my tongue,  
I had spent the past year or two getting over it,  
assuming it was dead, and picking up all the broken bits.

I've made a tapestry and a mosaic,  
mounted on as few walls as I could make it take,  
though important, it was just a sliver of a history,  
a punchline to the epilogue of the first chapter of this story.
