I'm scared to go home alone,  
and I'm hoping that I won't,  
I'm tired of these hard-to-follow and  
too-dense string of quotes.

Can't we make this easy?  
leave me only with the doubting,  
of the bodies in the night,  
that may or not be haunting.

Seeing something move in the dark is going to hit different for a little while.  
I suppose it's fitting. That's how I met her, that's what she leaves me with.
