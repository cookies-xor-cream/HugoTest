Seeking something always means  
preventing another from seeing  
the little joy annealed,  
that they had tried to steal.

Fangs and teeth in airborne sprees,  
find the purpose inside the breeze,  
of a rabid feeling they can't flee,  
a thorny thing that will never set them free.

For only in the lackthere of their presence,  
can their missing equate to our salvation.  
It is forged and branded into your essence,  
that any ploy at 'us' excludes all convalescence.
