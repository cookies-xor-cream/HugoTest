I'll mark my path  
and then I'll hound,  
I'll snake the words  
when they are found.

Think of words I waste  
but seldom breathe, then  
bleed the whiskey's taste  
till it secedes.

There's a thousand things  
I shouldn't say,  
and even more  
I shouldn't think.

But I'm treading ground  
and marking seas,  
on broken boats  
that slowly sink.

And if you find  
my dying light:  
just bid farewell  
please say goodnight.

We'll slowly sink,  
we're at the edge,  
so come and teeter  
out from this ledge.

We'll slowly sink  
down waterfalls,  
as this planeship of a boat,  
begins to throttle and to stall.
