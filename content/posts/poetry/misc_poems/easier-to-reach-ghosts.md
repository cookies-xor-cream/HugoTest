title: Is It Easier To Reach Ghosts Than The Living?

I'd really like a diagnostic  
for what's cutting our time short,  
one last speedy discourse,  
one final quick retort.

I wasn't born a medium,  
so I'll hold a s√©ance in reverse,  
let me possess the ghost,  
I'll inherit her that curse.

I'm writing on a mirror,  
and it isn't even fogged,  
but it holds all of the timesheets,  
that I never will have logged.
