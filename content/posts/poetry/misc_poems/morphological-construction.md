If I can recant, I can recall,  
but if I can't decant  
where remembrance falls,  
then maybe I can't "cant"?

I dropped the morpheme,  
lit some phosphene,  
it looks like reduction's  
met its match.

We've got options  
at the edge of Carthage,  
the canthus of phoenicia holds  
a sentence sent to garbage.

The kingdom lives on trade,  
I want my null on the prefix,  
I'll give a negation for its place.  
There's no affix you can't remove,  
no modifier that you can't displace.
