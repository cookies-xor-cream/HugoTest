I couldn't sleep on Friday,  
hypnotics wouldn't suffice,  
I need Hypnos and a scalpel,  
for wakefulness to be excised.

Saturday was different,  
hit the bed so hard it knocked me out,  
I don't remember the nightmare,  
but know what it must've been about.

I'm so tempted this morning,  
to return the Friday night favour,  
but two hours is too much transit,  
I've got work to do.

Maybe come next week,  
I'll visit you?
