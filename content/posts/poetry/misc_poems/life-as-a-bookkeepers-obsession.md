She's been stuck in my head since I saw her last,  
must've been last night, but I can hardly keep track.  
this can't be an encore of what me and Amber had,  
our calendars are too spangled to live life like that.

I glued myself to my window after,  
thought I'd be safer from the outside looking in,  
I've got the thread, I've got a vision of a plan,  
and a stare like a pin, that I'm keeping at hand.

I'm gonna watch The Watcher,  
gonna catch The Catcher,  
I'll collect The Collector,  
that derelict defector.

I'll watch her shed her titles,  
and leave me all of mine,  
whether by murderous inheritance,  
or a domestic half-hearted flight.

Either way, she'll leave me one of these nights.
