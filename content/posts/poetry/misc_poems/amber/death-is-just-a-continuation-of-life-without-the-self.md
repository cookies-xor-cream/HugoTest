She thought there was a solution to the halting problem,  
in the form of a suicide, but she blundered,  
I woke her up in a pool of her vomit,  
told her that rock bottom's now her new summit.

"I love you but don't know how to handle this,  
tell me you're already dead, so that I can pack my things",  
but she told me that she never felt less free,  
like a message in a bottle, cinched onto the bottom of the sea.

I pincered her below her cheeks,  
and told her that she had to speak,  
but all the sound that she could make  
was *"therapy don't do the trick for me,*  
*The talking just won't take"*.

"Raconte-moi, tu t'attendes à quoi?"  
*"Peut-être ma vie, mais sans moi?"*
