*"My dearest kindred,*  
*there is no existence but the one that is relative".*

I swear to god the paradoxical self-parody  
of this self-fulfilling prophecy is getting  
a little out of hand,  
but the supply axiomatically equates to the demand.

It is for it believes, believes for it commands,  
and it declares for it has regal thoughts,  
intrinsically, like the shifting sands of  
an oasis mid-desert mirage in a mind that's sitting still.

It's nothing if it isn't its own self-obsessed homage.
