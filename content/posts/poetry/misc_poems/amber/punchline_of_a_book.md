Since you recommended me fiction that was real,  
here's some non-fiction that isn't.

It's been a couple weeks since we parted,  
this is a lapse in all my better judgement,  
but I need for you to meet this grief,  
so I'm here digging for her number,  
(I only feel a nothing, know I'll have an easy sleep,  
knowing that you are struggling to recover).

I called her to have her pass the phone,  
so I could scream you into deafness,  
for an insult in a suggestion  
to a genuine fucking question.

This is the last you'll hear me speak,  
and the only time I've ever screamed,  
never had to find a quiet street,  
for fear of the volume of a call.

I let that thought sleep for six long years,  
not for fear of the dead, or the ghosts inside my ear,  
but for the reasons behind the choices,  
or the lack thereof, that I might never hear.

I got distracted by a shiny thing,  
I lost the thread, life tugged the string,  
but now alone, I found myself
with an ocean in between.

And so I guess I'll take you up,  
along with all the rest of them,  
I suppose that I might give a try,  
and I'll skim through it then.

It was the penultimate exchange we'd have,  
it was the footnote to our parting starting,  
and you chose to use those final breaths,  
to set a timer for my heartstrings plucking.

I'm not angry at the insult,  
I could barely even care,  
I'm just angry after a dozen years,  
you choose my leaving to set this snare.

What hope have you of catching me?  
And if you do, what waits for you and me?  
Say I come to Lisbon, assume I stay the month,  
what the fuck might happen that changes  
anything this time?
