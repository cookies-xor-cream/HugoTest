I'm so fucking bad at weddings,  
and im even worse at funerals,  
replied that I'm not going  
on all the ones that I've been invited to.

But I suppose that this time  
it's different, and I should go,  
because for the first time in forever,  
I actually do want to.

I remember showing at a wake,  
it was being held for Arya,  
and it felt a little awkward,  
that we both shared the same name.

The entirety of the invite list  
was 20-something drunkards,  
sneaking booze till half-asleep,  
like a wake of broke-willed buzzards.

Maybe it was just a brown-people thing,  
but they were all adorned in black,  
fancy fantastic drapery,  
that my wardrobe sorely lacked.  
(I don't think elegance looks too good on me,  
if I was to respond perfectly honestly).
