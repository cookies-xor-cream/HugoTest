There was something in her voice  
when it washed over me,  
my ears would stop,  
and filter out the noise.

It'd been a while since I'd been by,  
and I can't say that I'm happy,  
but I can say that I'm proud.

There was something in eyes  
when it locked with mine,  
that killed me slow,  
but it made me feel alive.
