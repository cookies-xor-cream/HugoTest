*"You have a one track mind,*  
*is how I'd put it I suppose.*

you didn't change and never had,  
so grab a drink and place it in my hand".

When she asked me I then shot a look,  
and I wish that that was all it took

*"Been sober the past fucking year,*  
*and I never even got to deliver.*

*Wasted time and effort spent,*  
*but I'm not broken, I'm only bent".*

'Then go ahead and sleep at night,  
turn off the amber bedroom lights.'

*"Word play's nice but got no place,*  
*if I drink now I'm drunk posthaste.*

*There's a generational gap, you know,*  
*but what I could've had won't let me go.*

*The nightmares stay, they'll never part*  
*I need them finished for a clean slate start.*

*And I know you know that they're gonna stay,*  
*I can see it written across your face".*

Her skin reacts to the light like glass,  
and she don't seem shattered, but that's just an act.

"The only writing's on the wall,  
I may be stumbling but you're gonna fall.

Just don't come calling, stay abroad,  
that's something I would applaud,

Of all the stupid choices made,  
that's the only one that I'd applaud,  
or out loud, anyways".
