Just got home at almost 9, you convinced  
me to use a pickup line I hated,  
on a boy I didn't even like, and I suppose  
you cant exempt my actions, not with  
just reference to the time.

But the passer-by declined,  
so I suppose that it turned out fine,  
fuck me, how's it only 9?

I got lipstick stains on a buttoned shirt,  
from an early night whiskey investment,  
I'll barter your thoughts down to a penny,  
you raise me another to pry my words away from me.

It probably doesn't read like how it happened,  
there's no double entendre or insinuation,  
my friend just reminded me that lipstick exists,  
and so I thought I'd add it to this situation,  
and it seems to stick.

I'm so happy to drop these random run-ins,  
these halfhearted meet ups with total strangers,  
and so I replied an instant yes when you  
suggested that we're in danger of wasting away a Saturday night.

I got no love bites, just a statement of intent,  
to prove the markings on my shirt  
are only fabricated evidence.
