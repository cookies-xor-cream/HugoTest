Vulpine thing, where have you been,  
sunder me from this accursed week,   
brand me using a poking iron,  
with an insignia of the meek.

No one holds a candle to the passage,   
but we can go to heaven, plant an adder,  
watch the serpent's poison bite,  
knock a rung or two off this ladder's height.
