I wanna call her, ask her why,  
this suggestion of an insult  
of the best book I've ever read,  
was so imperative to send.  

If I ask her why in anger,  
then I've taken some offence,  
which means I know exactly why,  
thus annuling my defence.  

I need some pretence,  
I need some pretence,  
can't you pretend,  
that I have the pretence?
