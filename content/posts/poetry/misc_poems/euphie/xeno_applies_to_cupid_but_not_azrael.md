I wish the reaper took his 15 minute OSHA mandated water break,  
but who are we with stern demands, so stubborn in for what we ask,  
killing death can't be a next week's Thursday pass time's task,  
we need Xeno, it's a god damn supertask, the thing we're requesting.

"I don't want my death to be painless,  
just quick enough that the torture  
don't get a second chance to sink in".
