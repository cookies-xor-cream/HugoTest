Persephone pray tell,  
what's this giftwrapped in red,  
that tastes like the summer,  
but rends the foliage lead.

Now, I see that it's cold,  
did you bring me the fruit,  
to mark the start of the season?  
coz I brought lemon juice.

We can mix up the two,  
like they do at the steppes,  
oh I know that you're Greek,  
but this is the best.

Just trust me, it's good,  
you can try it and see,  
and if you do like it,  
please let the winter go free?
