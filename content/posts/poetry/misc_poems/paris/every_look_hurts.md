If I could stick a pin to prick  
and fasten deep into your skin,  
then I would run the thread in lieu  
of scarlet lines all drawn to you.

They'd replace the lasersights,  
that scoped rifle that you call eyes,

The zoom is far too harsh for me,  
every glance just makes me bleed in vain.

I am nothing but a frankensteining,  
an amalgamation of my pain.
