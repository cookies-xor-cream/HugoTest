"Come inside, make yourself at home,  
It's raining out, I can't just let you roam alone".

*"If I step inside, I'll stay the night,*  
*And I need to make it home tonight".*

"I'll get you blankets, whatever you might need,  
we'll take turns at taking showers, you could  
go first and use up all the heat?"

*"You're pretty smart, so tell me sweetheart,*  
*if we have a coffee, and we take a seat,*  
*do you think that I could leave?"*

"I'm not asking for forever, I'm not  
overextending my reach.  
I only asked for a single night,  
and a morning I could steal".

*"I would love more than anything,*  
*to wake up here, but I know better,*  
*and I'm certain I can make it home.*  
*So let's dot the i's and abandon this last letter".*

"This feels like I'm accounting,  
cooking books I'll be stuck  
fixing up this ledger, but boy,  
I'm a chooser, not a beggar".
