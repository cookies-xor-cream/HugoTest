I couldn't wait for Azrael to weather burning wings,  
and the Muslim in the girl that raised me thinks that that's a sin,  
but the both of us know all too well, that we're at risk to make the pact,  
and likelier than I to play that game and to enact.

She has her lilies and her roses sat in vases all assorted,  
like the symbolism for a life that she couldn't have aborted,  
so sit me down and play a tune now, that we both share a muse,  
amuse me as we pass the time, and dig in sand to draw a line tonight.

Please wisen me I've been curious,  
how does a gemstone fail disperse,  
the light that's shone now overdue,  
it stopped and chose to shine right through.
