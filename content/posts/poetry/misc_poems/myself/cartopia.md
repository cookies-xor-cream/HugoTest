The dying light of morning stuck,  
clung by chilly, smokey air,  
and the pigeon/finch soundbite spells,  
that died to the highway at 6:00am.

The daylight's breath of car-soaked fumes,  
was a single oxide shy of safe,  
as each machine layed traffic-queued,  
to kill the world and dig its grave anew,

The clearest sight by the streetside view.
