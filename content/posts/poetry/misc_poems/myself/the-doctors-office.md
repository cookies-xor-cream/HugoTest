I hate these syllabic ramblings  
of these feelgood and these speakfast feelings,  
soupy spurs of words spun long  
spun till they roll right off your tongue.

They're bled dry, and they are devoid of meaning  
and anything vaguely human-seeming,  
what in heaven's name is the obsession?  
Hey doc, I'm done, let's call this session!
