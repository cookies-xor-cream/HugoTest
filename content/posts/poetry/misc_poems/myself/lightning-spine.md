title: A Lightning Bolt Has Been Working It's Way Through My Spinal Column For Years

I swear at some point in my sleep  
I had each vertebra removed,  
so my vagus could be copper-strung,  
a little fire, and a little crackle  
imbued in every rung.

Conduction for a pillar storm  
nerves doubled as lightning rods,  
like a prayer made on my behalf,  
to whichever thunder god.

And every time life sees me dimmer  
my vigilance a little too close to 'off',  
it plugs me in using tunnel  
that's digging through my spine.

I swear sometimes when a bad one hits  
that it's the end of the fucking line,  
I can feel the resistance of the metal  
burning through my little borrowed time.

The scans all came out empty,  
or as empty as they'd hoped,  
been sitting on this for near two weeks,  
but this time nothing seems as bleak.

I think that maybe recently,  
it might've been all of the sitting,  
putting pressure on the fluid building,  
that let the lighning slowly sink straight in.

But it reached the scar from the surgery,  
I just wish the next step to come  
is that it might exit me.
