I thought it would hurt,  
but embers burnt my nerves,  
and diminished the pain  
that they intended to serve.

The cold and static's  
the best delivery,  
but also too fast  
of a recovery.

I can tell that it  
wants to make me bleed,  
but bleeding is the buoyancy  
I need to be standing on my feet.
