I wrote the gospels in my sleep,  
essays and short-form writing,  
that I can't seem to read,  
but each word sits there biting me.

They tell me how I feel,  
I don't know how much I believe,  
how much of it's delirium,  
passed from through a cosmic sieve.

But I guess I like the imagery,  
and though I'm in love with the recounts,  
I wouldn't make choices, not on their behalf,  
nothing based off their account.

As insightful as they might be,  
I feel like I was born with blindness,  
and my pulse is the tapping of a cane,  
that kills me with its dismal likeness.

I lived so long so calculated,  
but I'm listening to my heart instead,  
even if it fills my eyes with blood-beats,  
I'd rather be seeing red than never see.
