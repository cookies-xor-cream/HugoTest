The technician said I was breathing fast,  
but my heart's going faster, at a mile a minute,  
if I want to outlast the end of everything,  
then a lung of mine has got the air for that in it.

A third of my airways are full just in case,  
emergency airtanks sitting, waiting, idly in place,  
I didn't know that cardiac muscles could stick tensed,  
but my chest cavity's repleted the oxides that I waste,  
or at least, it's trying its very fucking best.

I've only drowned a single time,  
so I'm running this drill fairly unrehearsed.  
sometimes I fear she's watching me,  
and other times, I feel that it's deserved

I feel it at appointments I make alone.  
the dread of waking up, dissociated,  
with new scars, and bleeding, fresh to boot,  
that I couldn't quite seem to place.

I rummaged through my everything,  
with delusions of my literacy,  
but being literate needs some sense,  
and I have lost all five now left in me.

But through my stupor,  
through this shallow ghastly fugue,  
I must have held some clarity,  
"She's not coming, it's only you?"

I asked that to no one,  
the only other: a nurse,  
too enthralled in her panic  
to recall anything of language.

I was confused momentarily,  
my thoughts were evicted quick,  
in preference machination's beeping.  
displaced by machines and electronic screaming.

As the room darkened,  
and in a final clarity, my eyes,  
they wandered to meet hers:  
I saw the fear plastered to her face.

Something was wrong.  
but it wasn't going to be.  
not for long, on any account.  
either exit was okay with me.

"Funny, aren't they. Those numbers.   
They say I should be sleeping".

She calmed for a moment,  
took another look at the LCD,  
and suggested I should be  
somewhere deeper than a sleep.

I would barter away the frenzied rising peaks,  
if it put me in a permanent coma, a lasting dream.
