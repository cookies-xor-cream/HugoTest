There's no person or thing I meet past 9pm  
who has remotely close to enough evidence,  
to convince me that they're really real,  
that I'm really sharing in their presence.

I don't need reality, instead I choose to do better,  
I just let it happen, I just let the moment pass,  
but every once a while they leave me marked,  
it's a shame that these scars will never last.

I swear the entirety of my having been,  
is classified as 'suspicious circumstance',  
too many things must fall into place,  
like's it's a deliberately orchestrated cosmic dance.
