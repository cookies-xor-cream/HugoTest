Sunspots scrolling across half-closed eyelids,  
from speedbump highbeams that I can't rid,  
I've got a migraine clawing at the front,  
of the inside of my face with all its might.

I'll entertain your pestilence,  
and the remnants of heavy-weighted insolence,  
just know if I crash with this velocity,  
I'll set free the spirit and the essence inside of me.

Heaven, hell, or purgatory, wherever I might find,  
I'll finally find myself free,  
living in a day without a night.
