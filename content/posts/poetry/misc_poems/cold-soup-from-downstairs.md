I need the railing for my balance,  
but I need to fall to understand,  
reason's arrested my stance,  
and I've lost the grip inside my hands.

Give me a balance beam,  
I'd rather fly than struggle,  
and however my thoughts read,  
they're not written in rebuttal.

We had a church now we have rubble,  
started a religion so we could boil the trouble,  
but it only ever wants to simmer,  
to slowly cook away these sinners,  
in their own alligator tears.
