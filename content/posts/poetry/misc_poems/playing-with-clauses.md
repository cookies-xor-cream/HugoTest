She asked "qui est?"  
I told her that the answer to the question,  
is nothing foremost, but if she's so  
desperate for the contentment of another,  
then she can solve that last equation,  
by the inversion of confusion,  
and the addition of a subject.

But the verb needs lost the object,  
the sentiment lends solely to a subject,  
defying its transitivity,  
for what's outwards here,  
is in need of permutability,  
it's reflexive (if it's anything),  
only directed straight and back to me.
