title: Lightning Is The Excess Of Moonlight Fighting Through The Stratosphere

I'm late and found myself scattered scarcely on a bench,  
then found the beauty cached inside a nimbus wrench,  
the limbs of moonlight that fizzled, dimly clenched,  
wrapped by clouds, in the palid light they couldn't seem to fetch.

Someone cut up the moon, again, in half,  
I reached out splaying the fingers on my hands,  
but for lack of reach, or for lack of wisdom,  
I found myself apart, and the distance spanned a kingdom.
