title: Pending Atomic Transaction During An Application Of Bayes' Rule

Bayes would kill me or hand a trophy  
if he saw how I had used his rule.

The instant I know something new,  
is the instant I don't think it through.

What I'm doing's a discontinuous function,  
of all the shit that's been done before.

And I've indexed you but weighted time,  
so much more than I did before.
