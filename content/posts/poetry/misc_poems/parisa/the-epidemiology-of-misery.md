*"She loved that*  
*eulogy that You*  
*don't remember*  
*even writing.*  
*hung onto*  
*every word,*  
*and every*  
*paranormal sighting".*

"It takes  
just a word,  
to find the start  
to a story,  
I won't breathe  
newfound life,  
into a long-dead  
anthology".

*"Write her back,*  
*just a single letter,*  
*I see 'thank you',*  
*in pause on your lips,*  
*but I know it can't*  
*be meant for me,*  
*so must be aimed at*  
*something better?".*

"That's how it starts,  
I did a year apart,  
to get that wrench  
out the clockwork  
of my heart,  
I couldn't take  
a restart, we can't set  
this straight enough".

*"I got a sorry note,*  
*a 'happy birthday'*  
*that she had*  
*chronically misspoken,*  
*and it made me*  
*start to think that*  
*maybe she's just broken?".*

"I compartmentalise  
way too fucking well,  
like I'm a vendor and  
this is the hardest  
fucking sell.  
But I was never  
going to invalidate  
my ticket out of hell".

*"She was hell?",*  
*'Hell is where*  
*You put it',*  
*"But have you*  
*All the space,*  
*For a realm below*  
*This stagnant plane?"*

"I'll find a way to fit it".
