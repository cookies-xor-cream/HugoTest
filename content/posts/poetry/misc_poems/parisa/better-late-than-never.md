The more sleep I get, the more lucid I can wake,  
and being awake's is to live in vain,  
to watch her eyes try to catch the rain,  
in their best attempt to wade through all the pain.

Clairvoyant, but for the past,  
delphi, through assimilation,  
barred from exile, from her outcast,  
the visions tamed to scarcely spread,  
thin enough to blur the scrawlings off her face.

I told a friend and she asked me:  
"Are you brave, or are you numb",  
I replied *"I'm not dissociated, I believe,*  
*that's why I'm not having any fun".*

The previous times this knife had pressed,  
the edge was sharp, could penetrate,  
but surrendered skin to see me pressed,  
was it better never, than way too fucking late?

Don't answer that, it's not asked for you,  
it was rhetorical and a responding to  
is the most saline thing that you could do,  
I don't need a resalting of my wounds.

So, was it better never than too late?  
no, though I should've left her in her grave,  
it was a wonderful, joyous play-pretend,  
until the dreamscape's bitter end.
