I sat in the dark and promptly called for you,  
you asked me how in the midnight I knew  
that your presence had made us two.  
I told you "suddenly I felt cold, and alone,  
I felt so fucking empty, and abandoned,  
and I could only ever feel like that with you".

And so we had a talk about the lines we drew,  
about the borders where I ended, where permission  
fell strictly, and solely onto you.

There's nothing you can't do.  
With one exception: that isn't action,  
but marked fully by intention.

I'm not your priest or therapist,  
but I'll eat the calibre of your  
final lonely confession.

It's stuck barrelled in your chamber.  
You'll tell me, we'll decouple,  
resuming as a lost girl and a stranger.
