The buzzards got me down in the dirt,  
hit me hard on the back of the head,  
they've got me struggling, feeling the hurt,  
lost patience, didn't wanna wait for my death.

My breath's been paralysed, I'm asphyxiating now,  
got dust on your wings, and I'm an allergy deep,  
I just need some sleep, but I've forgotten how,  
every time I close my eyes I see the call of the deep.

Cage me.  
Free me.  
Set me loose.  
That you feel,  
the way you do,  
is such a sorry excuse.

Hurt me.  
Nurse me.  
Heal me quick.  
We're burning down  
through the wax and  
the last of the wick.
