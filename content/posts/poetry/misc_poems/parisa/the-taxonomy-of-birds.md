Oh, folly to fools,  
but my blunder is moot,  
for I'd rather have loved  
the deaf than the mute.

The thing that you did  
is now taloned as part  
of the hook in my heart  
that's digging in hard.

And I'd like it detached  
from the haphazard attach,  
of your optical latch  
and the feelings you catch.
