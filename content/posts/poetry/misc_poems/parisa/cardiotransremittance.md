'The Friday Night Favour'

I've got work in the morning,  
had an encounter in the park,  
could only barely see you there,  
all wrapped up in the dark.

You lit the joint and took a drag,  
from the smoking halo of the abyss,  
your voice broke, so wrought with guilt,  
for thought of the contact I'd never miss.

You took some time to gather words,  
to string together suggestions phrased  
in a phase that was offset from mine,  
using gestures that retowed every line.

Give me a sign or I'll make the signage,  
a signal for a heart that's short the mileage,  
odometers don't count how far we've come,  
they count the drags left in a dying sun.

For when it snuffs, you're gone again,  
you'll vanish, dissolving all the pain,  
but leave a hole where you had stayed,  
pigeonholed: a receipt that friendship payed.

But the pigeonhole was empty now,  
no stranger to your vulpine claws,  
the corvid had then long since flown,  
and now, I suppose, alone we roam.
