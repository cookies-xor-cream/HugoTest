"I think I should take it as a sign  
that the best in you brings out  
the worst in us.

That the closer you meander,  
the further I tear apart, the more  
I rip asunder.

I'm not filler, I didn't give you keys  
to let you in, I gave them to you to  
set me free.

I want to see you, but not this often,  
though you'll hold no record of me if I  
wait until next quarter.

I thought that options were deterence,  
but they only facilitate the missing time,  
and all of its transference".
