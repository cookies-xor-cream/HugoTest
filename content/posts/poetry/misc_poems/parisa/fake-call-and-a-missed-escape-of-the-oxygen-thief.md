You've got galvanised liquor,  
I've got an anodised tongue,  
so our blood types mismatch,  
and so do our eyes.

You've got three there in place,  
while I'm short now a lung,  
from your stealing my air,  
it's anxiety-wrought.

Though this time around  
our friendship was brief,  
I'm glad to have known you,  
through the thick and the thin,  
my dear beloved,  
my little oxygen theif.
