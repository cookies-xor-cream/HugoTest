On love and war,  
I'd wager every star,  
I'd put all my money  
on 'we could have it all'.

We've come so far,  
from out the dark,  
but friendship's not  
a one-time stop.

We forgot the  
journey on the way  
is like a destination  
in which we can't stay.

Coz staying moving  
isn't staying at all,  
moving need freedom,  
and staying needs walls.
