There'a thing I feel helplessly  
and violently till the end,  
so I still feel the way I did,  
but now I need you out my view.

Every feeling that I catch,  
seems to infinitely last,  
so despite what's in my heart,  
this dislike will never come to pass.

The hate like a disease,  
is spreading from you to me,  
just this time now,  
love won't put it at ease.
