She had scarring straddling down her arms,  
a mixed bag of keep-sakes and trinkets,  
from crashes, burns, self-harming, sex.

I think the half decade age difference,  
and her ex's proclivity for violence,  
gave her a warped view of what love meant.

But I don't think that I could relate.  
what one means to me is a debate  
that's aired on a per-person basis,  
the answer ranging from typhoons to stasis.

But she had a tendency for whiskey  
and to constantly remind me,  
not a single mark belonged to me.

I hated wearing the paintings that she left,  
but loved the black crescent dental imprints,  
they served as evidence of the ichor bled.

So I suppose that this is tribute,  
to the four hour walking commute,  
to carry back effigies of my friend, the buzz saw,  
to give my arm as sacrifice, for her to gnaw on.
