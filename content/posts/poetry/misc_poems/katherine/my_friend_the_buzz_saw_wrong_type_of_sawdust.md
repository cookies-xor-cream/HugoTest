I swear that every time we touch,  
there's static clung onto our skin,  
like cling-wrap-clad lightning,  
that makes our contact try to rescind.

I told you to keep both  
your hands far, far away,  
but it's looking like that's  
gonna be a two player game.

She's an electric stuffed teddy,  
with sewn-on button-eyes,  
but little did we know that  
the plastic only conducts if it dies.

She's the voltage in the wire,  
or a garden shed's worth  
of buzzsaws and of sanders  
that grinding me to dirt.

And if she can kill me,  
we'll see that she does,  
coz it's either me or it's her,  
there can only be one.

And my money's on her  
grinding my bones down to dust,  
and I wouldn't even struggle,  
I really couldn't be fussed.

But it looks like she finds it hard,  
to break open my skin,  
to separate the chambers of my heart,  
as if that is her final sin.
