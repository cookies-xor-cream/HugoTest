Acuity is now dodging us,  
in every form but optical,  
the bromine and the dragonfly  
they took your sight away.

Leave them here, your sable eyes,  
I'm waiting by the underpass,  
the clock can't tick we froze it's time,  
and now its time can't come to pass.

But we're too deep in, we're two deep now,  
with two of each, we're asking how,  
the four we took have robbed your eyes  
of the chroma you have tried to hide.

By the babbling brook, and wailing sea,  
the rivers scream into a stream,  
the lizards and the snakes around,  
have dropped from vision and turned to sound.

She asked if you were up.  
You smiled at every ask,  
of how aware you were,  
or would ever be at last.

She waved around her threats,  
and screeched for her to take you home,  
but the threat of dying slowly sank  
like a lake eating a stone.

I wish that you had stayed asleep,  
and lost yourself in vivid dreams.  
But you had lost your sable eyes,  
your eyes were hazel, charred inside,

Fire browned,  
all cut up and cauterized.
