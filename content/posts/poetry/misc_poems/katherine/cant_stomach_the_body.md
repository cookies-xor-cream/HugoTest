Come add your poison to this brew,  
but you don't you tell me what it is,  
I don't want to have a clue.

We'll drink it and we'll pass,  
then if we wake I'll promise you,  
we'll make this moonlight last.

I'll clue you in and strap the seat,  
and we'll walk all of the beaten paths,  
whilst we'll rip into the meat.

Coz I wanna see the fibres split,  
coz I wanna see the worst of it,  
I wanna see it painted like a crime scene,  
but god I'm burnt out on the grit I need.
