I'm not scared of you  
the way I am of her,  
I know who you are,  
and how much you must care.

This insistence isn't fair,  
I don't need chronology,  
I don't need a 5 minute  
dialogic anthology.

You did the same shit  
that she had done,  
and I wish I could say  
this wasn't any fun.

But getting my friend back  
might've been worth the trauma,  
I only wish we skipped the end,  
and ended this sans the drama.

Got a call from you,  
you told I'm not home,  
and I know that myself,  
but why do you know it too?

I wish that I could leave,  
more obvious of a clue,  
than edging a panic attack,  
and the most explicit of "fuck you"s.

Go home to your kid,  
he must miss his mother,  
what is it you're looking for?  
all he needs is cookie-cutter.

Tell me angel,  
tell me fairy,  
how is it that  
we close this story?

With you tethered,  
and attached to me?  
with me shaking  
every time we meet?

I have half a mind  
to stay out tonight,  
to make my way home  
in the morning's Amber light.

But that isn't enough,  
bet you'll still be at the park,  
till long past the morning-break,  
lurking longer than the dark ahead.

Your shadow and your silhouette  
couldn't hold a candle,  
to the paranoia in my head,  
that I barely just can handle.

This has been a ramble,  
and I've still sentences to spare,  
I wish you disappeared,  
and removed me from this snare.
