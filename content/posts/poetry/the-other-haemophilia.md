I asked if I could gift to you that night,  
a bruised necklace in my remembrance,  
the red, and black, and purple streaks as  
markers for your condolence and your penance.

Anemic blood still tastes so much like it's metal,  
and were you a flower I would tear off each last petal,  
of the orchid, parasitic, wrapping closed around my bark,  
eating from the outside in: from my husk, into my heart.

I left my dental records on your throat,  
you're not an xray, but you're close.  
For imprinted on your neck I see  
the outline of the diagnosis to  
a vampiric tendency.
