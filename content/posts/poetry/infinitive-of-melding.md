I'm stuttering at every  
stumble of a thought,  
those that I have Lost,  
and Those I Never Found.

I doll, and sit, and wait at last,  
just gotta string on one more day,  
with the chatter and my idle words  
of this sated clapping trap.

Hear me out, then question me,  
a keynote on the rest of it,  
floating on the restless sea,  
of work and meaning that I  
never could've knit.

Work's almost over, I'm due a break,  
we've hit the sand and woke the worm  
up from distant pasts.

We've broke the dunes and now we get  
our break as it must lay entombed  
to course-correct; to meld at last.
