This is an open letter to the atmosphere,  
summer was hard with the heat stuck over here,  
thanks for waking me before you woke the sun,  
looks like you also beat him to the punch,  
(means that I'm not the only one).

I wish that I could bottle this weather,  
I want this many celsius to last forever,  
a pillar of rain struck the ground besides my feet,  
a solid column of water where a stagnant sky meets the sea.

Can't help but wonder if I'm just crazy,  
or the waterfall was trying to talk to me,  
but if the sky is reading this: I'd like to give my dues,  
for the fact that this year's summer,  
isn't so far overdue.
