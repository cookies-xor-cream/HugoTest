Can't get anything done,  
you're stuck in my head,  
can't work with the thought,  
so I'll work when I'm dead.

Guess that's a fair enough trade,  
I'll take it, won't blink,  
I can blink in the future,  
but now, I can't help but think.

You're a sinkhole of thought,  
you're a prion set loose,  
you're heating me up,  
and burning the fuse.
