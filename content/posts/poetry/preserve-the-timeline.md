The first is misery, that's found fermented,  
it tinges sweet but with acetic hues,  
you somehow miss the caustic burn,  
even when remembering equates to self-abuse.

The second is a remembrance prayer,  
you know only blurs of truths raced past,  
They meet the sky and fizzle thin,  
you lost the metal, but kept the cast.

The third one is a vacant feeling,  
where you try it, but with quicksand rules,  
where aiming makes you miss the mark,  
and struggling means you lose the heart.

And the final one: its purest form,  
an uncut dose of pastimes dead,  
that comes comedown-less,  
and doesn't dare to spark the dread.

I think I find the disparity funny,  
like a testament to my priorities,  
the following is an ordered list,  
from one to four, the life I've lived.

From one to four, the past I missed:  
the first one's dead,  
the second moved,  
I don't care for this one,  
and the last one's a cartoon.
