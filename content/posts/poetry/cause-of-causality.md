You've been stunlocked all this time,  
by the pictures that we took of her,  
I'd like to think that I'm smarter,  
coz I gave mine all away.

She always had blood run between  
the length of her, down from her jeans  
and it reached up to her ghost white tees  
and ran the toll of lengthened sleeves.

And honestly if I described  
the clothes she wore or how she walked:  
it would be blasphemously wrong,  
I wouldn't know, it's been too long.

She's a murky phantom, there afloat,  
a silhouette that happened to be  
drowning aboard the same boat.  
But we've capsized now.

And I've sold my dreams  
At discount rate,  
God (don't) forbid  
We meet her fate.
