You think that thinking's a valid way,  
to logic out the shit you'd say.

But time is the slowest, strongest grinder,  
the coffee-from-mountains-and-trauma-finder,  
the accumulation of beans in fire.

You didn't even have the drink,  
you only breathed the citric dust,  
and that's a promise you won't keep.

But you know that you should wear a mask,  
though you can't be fussed or bothered so.

So you gargle-blood the night away,  
and know the doctor'll make you stay,  
if you tell them that it went this way.

And I don't have the patience but  
god I have the time.

Feels like the indirect-est way  
to make honesty a crime.
