The light and sound,  
both pale besides,  
the flashbang rooms  
and neon signs.

I waited out,  
I stalled for you,  
then I idled by,  
as I missed you.

It was 2 months then,  
I didn't know what the  
next month brought,  
but I do now.

At least I'm alive,  
I am alive,  
I was alive,  
**I am alive.**
