*"I don't know why all this wait,*  
*I feel like we've stopped crossing fates"*

And that final line was true:  
it spoke of the destiny That we'd accrued.

*"And now was overdue"*  
I could never live with you  
*"And I could never live without"*  
I hope the afterlife can sort this out

*"Or else I might take a chance,*  
*And end this shit by force tonight".*

That anachronistic thought  
had echoed in my head,  
as I had once recalled  
that we're worst friends

*"Of one long dead".*

*"A pistol speaks no love",*  
Since your fusillade can't hit a dove,  
*"You'll need bring passion"*  
With no heart

*"To bring yourself*  
*8o bring a knife".*

To bring a killing  
8o a wedding.

With hell betwixt  
your sorry smile  
and laden wrist  
conscript.

We'll overdose on non-prescripts.
