I, **'Funeral Eyes'**, loved to loiter on the St. Augustine rooftop, as if playing god. I often wondered when the priest pointed upwards, as if to heaven, if ever he pointed at where I was.

The roof was tiled with stone: small slabs of corrugated slate, as if warped by the bursts of heat and sudden snow storms; folded over themselves by the abusive mountain weather. The roof was pointed, with two faces joining at one edge, gesturing upwards to the sky. There was a weathervane accompanying the spire atop it all. A pretty thing, that spun on occasion; plastered to a metal frame that twirled too often for its seldom audience.

The cathedral was large, disproportionately so for the few and far between that graced it with their presence. It never found itself full, but likewise, was never fully empty either. Visitors were drawn there, not by force of habit, but by single occasions. There were few residents of the Sunday mass, and few subscribers to the sermons. What pulled the crowd was the graveyard, and the odd wedding. The size of the cemetary eclipsed that of the cathedral itself many times over. Somehow still, it still seemed adequately proportional when contrasted to its surrogate. I suppose, such was the nature of this place.

For the few regulars this cursed place saw, few found home within its walls. There was the priest, and there were the help staff: gardeners, and miscellaneous personnel dotted sparsely throughout the living quarters. And there was also me. The presence of the others made enough sense, but I think my existence here was quite apt given what lived (or rather, lived no longer) upon the grounds. I was lacking a room, or a shelter from the snow, but weather didn't bother me. There was no hot, and no cold for me, not really. When it rained, or it snowed, the water and ice would pass me through like light diffracting in a prism.

I was less a resident, and more a permanent distortion perched on the roof, like a self-indulgent hallucination. I missed my bed downstairs, well, I suppose it's no longer *my* bed -- but I missed it all the same. Although some might find it funny that one can miss a bed, past when they have lost the ability to sleep, or to dream for that matter. When one no longer needs to close their eyes. When one ceases to exist in the presence of a sunray. When the ultraviolet of the morning light is an eraser on the papyrus of existence.

I only exist at night. I only exist when the moon is dim enough not to run me through, but radiant enough to grant me my palid ghast of an existence. I dolled away the time, and grew in apathy with its passing. Time was less concrete in this reality. It was less something real, and more a medium that facilitated change. No longer measured in seconds, hours, or even days. It was the idea that the candles would shorten to a stump, and be replaced by a lonely stick of beeswax. It was measured in the volume of headstones that found themselves punctuating the graveyard, in ever increasing number.

I'm not sure what put me here. And I'm not sure of the purpose. I'm not even certain there is a *what* or a *why*. But my best guess is that I'm here to watch everything happen. The living are tasked to watch to living kin, and the dead are tasked to watch their kin, as I have been tasked.

My best explanation is that I am nothing but a pair of *funeral eyes*, and so that is the same that I have chosen.
