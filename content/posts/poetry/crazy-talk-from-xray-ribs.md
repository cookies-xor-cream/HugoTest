You came back from the doctor's,  
and the discussions of your bruise,  
but he didn't give you any pills,  
why'd you mention that you used?

It'd been a half year since  
shedding x-ray ribs, since the  
stitches got removed.

I mentioned home in passing,  
and then you were suggesting  
that I moved?
