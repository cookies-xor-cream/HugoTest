The last we saw of her that night,  
was the cawing and the laughs,  
of a cigarette-wielding parrot,  
trying to get into her pants

She was a parrot of her love,  
she was the reflection found inside,  
she was the sad truth that,  
she held a mirrors lacking doves.

She was the echoes of her tone,  
that reinforced what she thought,  
further, forevermore,  
a wooden house recast in stone.

And the concrete had to grow its wings,  
a tattered pair, but colourful,  
and light enough to catch and scoop  
the air found underneath.

She said that he was still:  
bluebottle eggs, on a buzzing lake,  
but she kept talking talking talking,  
talking for her sake.

coz she was a parrot of her love,  
and the dove was stuck inside,  
she told her that she loved her,  
but was just looking for a light.
