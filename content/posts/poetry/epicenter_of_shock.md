My jaw decided to wire shut,  
and I tried to tell you *'no',*  
but I've never wore such a heavy maw,  
so I lost the volume when I said *'go'*.

I'm sorry that my grip had stuck,  
but I'm just happy it was weak.  
You held my hand as it had struck,  
the napalm hit its peak.

I can't feel my fingers now,  
and I can't seem to find my tongue,  
I swear that I broke both our hands,  
whilst I was short a lung.

And if I buy you back a finger,  
would you just please just stay at length,  
I'm nervous there's an earthquake ringer,  
and you're sitting on the plate.

Coz you're right where all these faultlines grate,  
and there's nothing they can't shake.  
no, there's nothing that can take the quake,  
and live through right through, without a single break.
