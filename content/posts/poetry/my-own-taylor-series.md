Theres only so much one can know,  
at any given time.  
there's a bandwidth and a bitrate,  
intrinsic to this rhyme.

You know the momentum or displacement,  
of a cubic set of splines.  
that trace out with each successive draw,  
of breath on their outline.

Was I breathing?  
Heard a sigh?  
But would you care  
to answer why?

My inhale's the diving gradient,  
of the monotonic brought sentient,  
and I'll be decreasing come the time.

I'm the path formed by the splines,  
I'm the piecewise continuous function,  
of this droning slope's dysfunction.

But I know differentiation,  
is an operation that I cannot  
infinitely survive.  
And four times is the bound.

f(x) = ?
