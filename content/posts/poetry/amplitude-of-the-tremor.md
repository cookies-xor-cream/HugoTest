title: The Amplitude Of The Tremor Is A Function Of My Trust And Fear

The contrast is so fucking stark,  
but the expectation's flipped,  
between the spiked brandy and
the quiet suggestion that I sit.

I don't think I've cut my hair before,  
and not been ordered through,  
there's always been straps, and belts,  
and something else, in addition to.

Coz I'm used to being fastened,  
while met with nausea and heavy hands,  
parading on my pressure points,  
like raw nerves on a bed of sand.

This time it was liveable,  
I'd say flinch-less though I know,  
that I flinched a couple times,  
so maybe not flinch-less, but flinch-low.
