I'm caught between charybdis and Scylla.  
I'm coiled between a serpent and a snake.  
She held my hand as if to ask me,  
which of these one decisions I would make.

I'm caught by tassels serpentine,  
I'm coiled between a serpent and a snake.  
The scarlet is wrapping around me,  
and it tells me that it's only for my sake

But you have lived here so much longer  
in the same time that I haven't got to live.  
No break or bend can make you stronger  
you're a cactus stuck inside the desert heat.

You're a reptile that feeds on desert heed,  
you're the hedonism that is feeding on our greed.
