He said he wanted closure,
and all his questions answered,
but really he wanted butterflies and honey,
even if the saccharides only bring bodyflies,
And he's festering a corpse.

He scrambled through the pages,
dismissing the heavy drizzle-drainage,
and all the rest of the liquid damage,
he went to speak but every word he squeezed out
I sniped out of flight with my steely gaze.

I want to help him but I'm too far removed,
Hannah was never here, and Amber has since moved,
I'm all that he has left but he's searching for a ghost,
but it's been too long, and I have found repose.

Pack your things, pick your clothes,
you're stuck guarding an empty post,
we're abandoned at this dinner party,
by the cadaver of the memory of the host.
