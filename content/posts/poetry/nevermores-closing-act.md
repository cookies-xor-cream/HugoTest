We're a knifefight in a phonebooth  
and I was begging you to end it,  
but the truth isn't found in  
silty wounds.

Salt them, and I'll dust them,  
or I'll dust them off and break you,  
with pocketsand and fistfuls  
of your mace.

I just need some space and figure  
you might need some more.  
And it had been a week since we  
had watched the door.

Don't go, I'll leave and shake  
all the trouble you abhor,  
I'm nothing now, and you're nothing  
either anymore.

I was sitting bending breaking  
and I was praying then rescinding  
every prayer to every god that  
I had made.

But you licked your wounds,  
and bound your bruises,  
to the fixtures of these  
daylight corpses.

You opened up the door  
and you slammed it shut  
right with your casket  
and its gore.

And the phonebooth glass  
had shattered then, I lay  
quarterless and distant,  
By the door.

And if she had then called me,  
just yesterday, know I  
would tell the pair of you  
that the pair of us,
still would've been bored.

But the difference between the bored she was  
and the bored I could've been,  
is the boring of a hole that called the  
curtains to the scene.
