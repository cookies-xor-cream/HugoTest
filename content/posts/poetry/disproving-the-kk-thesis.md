I need the fucking verbosity  
to be thinking through the gravity  
of how cut up we got:  
bar the scars and scratches.

I still remember forgetting,  
the scenery sliding into a wreckage,  
I don't know what car you drove,  
but that shit must've been expensive.

I still forget recalling  
all of the shit you took to drive,  
and finding it all out after,  
but fuck it, you still drove okay.

And the last thing I remembered,  
was when I got reared by your car,  
and now I'm still a little afraid  
to help any of my friends when they park.

We were lucky to be alive throughout,  
but the scales can't tip that way forever,  
I suppose that it aggregates,  
and your luck was only average.

Chance made us bite guesswork's bullet,  
but I remember us mapping it out,  
like a single big decision graph  
of an Imperfect Information Game.

Everything else was subpar,  
we knew we were a funeral,  
or maybe a wedding, apart,  
from permanence or transience.

And the beta blockers,  
did they ever help?  
coz I still remember  
how your hands would start to shake.

I still remember your mum  
when she loved me,  
and when she didn't,  
but I don't remember her name.

Just fucking called her 'aunty'  
(I'm sorry)
