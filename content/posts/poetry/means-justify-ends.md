I picked up my phone ringing,  
with the disbelief in me chilling in "hello",  
she said she just wanted to her my voice,  
but this week's had my speech deposed.

So she asked about my Saturday,  
and I told her it felt fucking empty,  
I told her I need to see Ms Saturday,  
she said it's only been two weeks.

It's not the person, it's the ritual,  
I'm a cultist out of practice,  
she was all my Saturdays,  
please show me where the weekend is.

She pointed out the only light,  
to pierce this veil lived in the night,  
and if I was so in love with lunar things,  
I need to brave the darkness as it bites.

I suppose that she is right.  
I told her the only annoyance,  
was I wasn't ready for goodbye.  
but she told me it came packaged  
like giftwrapped airport baggage.

And whether into the ocean,  
solid ground, or a runway strip,  
this was a one way ticket,  
that I have to fucking keep.
