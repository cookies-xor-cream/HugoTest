title: Stuck In The Glass Lake Of A Local Extrema

Stick me in this lake of ash,  
while the fire lays expunged,  
it's stuck in perpetuity,  
blowing out a cast of glass

between the tachycardic trills  
of krill-filled breaths through filter-feed,  
you met your death by way  
of ambergris.

And I would cast you out a net,  
if you had arms to tie a noose,  
and I'd make so damn sure  
that it wasn't tied too loose.

That shit was a package deal,  
but you've got the exit scam  
and eyes like steel,  
that you can't seem anneal.

But we'll set *p* high,  
and bring it low,  
we'll watch the lattice  
as it forms.

We'll watch it run,  
with *t* increased,  
as we *'learn'*  
and we *'reform'.*
