A trip to the ER got me what I needed,  
and thank god, it was looking bleak.  
I get to extinguish these napalm hands,  
for the remainder of this week.

The lowered gaze and mumbled words,  
suggested that the fire might've spread,  
and my arms are numb now but still in tact   
and the pain's found second wind in my head.

I got an MRI scheduled this month,  
and I hope I can trap the panic inside,  
I just need a twenty minutes tremble-free,  
so let's see if I can hide the tremors inside of me.
