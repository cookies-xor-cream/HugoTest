The distance halves every stare I catch,  
descending increments in powers of two,  
that measure how close my face can get,  
before I could finally try reach you.

Like Achilles and the tortoise,  
there's infinite time until we touch,  
although it fits on a finite clock,  
I feel like I'm waiting too long; too much.

I'm the stroke of a paintbrush,  
that can't dry on the paving,  
feel like every sentence we swap,  
is one I've been saving.

And everything I want to say,  
is something that I shouldn't do,  
I don't know why I feel this way,  
I can't help it but to think of you.
