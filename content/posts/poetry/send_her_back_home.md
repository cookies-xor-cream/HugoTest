She called me slurring something adjacent to speech,  
so I had her pass the phone, had the drunkard impeached,  
and the call found itself with resin from a tree,  
that spent too long collecting rings to clearly see.

She told me to put a damper on my feelings,  
to put a mute on the sound of my heartstring flaying,  
told me I had freedom, autonomy of decision,  
but the freedom of a will translated into her faultline and fissure.

Almās, yāghout, you small sparkling vein of garnet,  
there's a hundred words and memories that you can harness.  
so why are you resorting to 'please' and 'Hannah',  
in the wrong dialect with your broken grammar?

She repeated herself, tried lifting the pressure,  
caught between the plates, in the faultlines and the fissures,  
"Arya, I'm not asking much I haven't before,  
just a postpone on a premature decision,  
you know what it's all for".
