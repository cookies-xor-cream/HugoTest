title: "The Proof Is Too Large To Fit In The Margin: My Last Theorem"

It's been a happier week,  
I'm lucky that life humbled me,  
without shattering my esteem,  
or at least that's how it seems.

Because sometimes I feel like  
this reads like a novel suspended  
in disbelief, but all the  
stories that I have, are rendered  
beyond recognition,  
such that they're paper thin.  
not to fit the page,  
but line the margins and the seams.
