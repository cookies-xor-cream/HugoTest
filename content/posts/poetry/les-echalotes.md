Fuck, it's like when you'd have too much speed,  
can't stay awake but you never caught any sleep,  
whilst our shut-eye stuck and fastened tight  
in a one-hour nightmare-dream each night.

And a bullet can grant a blackened view,  
but can you aim straight for the through-and-though?  
when love-borne-fear is haunting us, like an Abrahamic truth,  
it would sink in that it's permanent:

god I'd miss these backlit hues,  
but I don't miss the truth.

And your gifts were clothes in leafy greens,  
to race your heart through camouflage, that we had never seen,  
but when cutlery is thrown at me, I assume it's well deserved,  
to break the plates off which she ate, that never will be served.

The hairdresser couldn't touch my hair,  
I hated it, but she didn't care,  
she pulled on it, she held me fast,  
with an opened cork, and empty glass in hand.

No, I loved the chef with turned-off lights,  
the chopping shallots with sharpened knives,  
and the accidental blood-let glides,  
fuck, now I'd let each one slide.

But I didn't mind it if my shirt  
was riddled with a dozen tears,  
the lights were turned off,  
and the bleeding didn't hurt.

No the bleeding didn't hurt.
