With a shutter snap and full force flash  
she flatlined her batteries.

The lithium, it couldn't hold,  
the alkali had broke its mould.

A caustic spray of absentees,  
that never need RSVP.

The lead paint wore, its absence strung  
like fibrosis caught up in her lungs.

We wouldn't miss asbestos words,  
the turns of phrase and sharpened tongues.

I was left here, with these memories  
that didn't want to plug in the prise.

Then the sunlight stabbed as it must do,  
smouldered her goodbyes, and then her dues.

The only thing that was left on ice  
was her fascination with prepositions,

But especially the word *"through",*  
when it wore the past as a disguise.

And that stuck with me  
the whole damn way, straight through.
