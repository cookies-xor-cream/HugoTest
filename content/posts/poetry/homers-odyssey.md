Something wormed itself into this lore,  
and mythology in a last-ditch  
effort to misconstrue.

The self is a clipping of these monsters,  
which frets about the riverside,  
in a failure to rehearse.

I've got a pedigree of the bloodline,  
stuck between a set of options,  
all of which remain declined.

But after the wyrm's assassination,  
Charybdis was the proof, that another  
reduction results for us the lesser option.

I saw Charybdis' coronation,  
when I was shedding the sheathe,  
abandoning myelination in the heat.

I've got an inkwyrm in my head,  
soundbites from a script that I  
wish I'd never heard.

I've got Charybdis in my chest,  
a whirlpool of the ichor that  
bleeds when I profess.

I've got Scylla in my hands,  
a battle for where each  
and every touch could land.

I've got the manticore in my soul,  
an amalgamation of all the parts,  
of all the people from which I stole.
