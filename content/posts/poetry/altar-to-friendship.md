We dredged ourselves in this rabbithole,  
and we could never find the bottom,  
coz every time that we hit the ground,  
we'd find ourselves falling through the floor.

I was always waking up before her,  
she was strung like a mantlepiece on her bed,  
and I was beneath it on the bedroom floor,  
and caught her red-handed, with her fingers in my hair.

I wanted to stop her, but I couldn't really care,  
I just waited for her to wake,  
so I could meet her with a showdown of a gaze.
