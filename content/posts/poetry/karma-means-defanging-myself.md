Keep me breathing,  
I'll live with heaving,  
I don't hate you,  
I'm only grieving.

Thanks for all  
the breath I drew,  
and with each one  
I had thought of you.

And thought that I  
should forget about  
the nowheres and  
the roundabout.

You knew, coz I told  
you every week.  
But you say you didn't,  
and now I can't bear speak.

But that's old news,  
I know it is.  
I left you clues.  
I knew I did.

Just pull my teeth,  
and lay them bare,  
with locust swarms  
it might be fair.
