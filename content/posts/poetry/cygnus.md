I'm seeing you two days from now,  
but I don't think that I can wait,  
part of me wants to tell you now,  
and the other half wants to dodge this fate.

For I doubt that you might feel the same,  
but that's okay, an expected sight,  
just know, if you ever wish for something more,  
that I don't bark, and will never bite.

I'll be your lapdog, you'll have the leash,  
you'll be the bird that pulls my tether,  
my swan that's hunting for calmer weather,  
my cygnus sigil of a heart unleashed,  
a symbol of my avarice,  
and all the places that we could reach.
