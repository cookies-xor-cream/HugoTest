title: "Depth First Search On Reality; The Nurse Thinks I Have A Deathwish"

I woke up with a projection in my head,  
that played the image of a single bed,  
that was stuck in a whiteout reality,  
and couldn't escape its fluorescent gravity.  
The harshest lighting was shining down,  
the room was submerging, primed to drown,  
the whitest shimmer blacklisted everything,  
that my eyes connected with, through the dullest sting.

My vein unrolled like a garden horse,  
from a cannular that got deposed.  
graph the volume of the bleeding,  
see my heartbeat run receding,  
pulled the IV bag to read the label,  
but my eyesight is so far from stable.  
Then my pressure dropped to double sixties,  
so I saw the flaw and I whispered *"fix me?"*,  
the room was empty but I heard the beeping,  
that woke me up from the hypnagogia creeping.

I looked down to see the canvas painted,  
had I been a twitch more nervous I would've fainted,  
my arm was gashed, I pulled the needle sideways,  
but it's a one-scar limit per surgery anyways.

The nurse panicked, asked what got into me,  
I told her I tried to stop the nightmare,  
that I tried to cull the feeling.
