I've got a canker sore now,
from taking your call,
and who's to hear this old tree,
if it shrivels and falls.

Will you pick up in the morning?
I've got a class before noon,
or will we shut the fuck up,
and parcel this gloom?

I long for a century ago,
coz the telephone lines,
though they'd give it a go,
wouldn't carry your cries.

They'd die and allay,
keep the violence at bay,
cut the sound for the night,
we'll resume in the day.
