I've got a canker sore now,
From taking your call,
And who's to hear this old tree,
If it shrivels and falls.

Will you pick up in the morning?
I've got a class before noon,
Or will we shut the fuck up,
And parcel this gloom?

I long for a century ago,
Coz the telephone lines,
Though they'd give it a go,
Wouldn't carry your cries.

They'd die and allay,
Keep the violence at bay,
Cut the sound for the night,
We'll resume in the day.
