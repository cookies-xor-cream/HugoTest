I thought she knew I didn't scar,
and in its stead I just bled ichor.

If you wanted to make me bleed,
you'd try knifeplay and to slice her.

I wasn't jealous that you got to,
if I had wanted it, I'd get it too.

But I'm jealous for the reason,
that I wanted me to want it too.

And I used to think about that,
in a time before I'd met another.

And realised that what I thought I wanted,
juxtaposed how I would always come to feel about her.

There was no straight segment on her skin,
that I'd let the iron pierce, or the point to try and pin.

There were no words that she could say,
to make me stop feeling it this way.

But there's one thing I could've done,
and it involves rigging my past luck:
I'd be blind, or in the hospital.
Retroactively, drowning in the dark.
