*"You know which one lurks my thoughts?*  
*Amidst the company of nights that you*  
*have learned to tame with ease, there's*  
*a single final one that you have never caught*  
*inside the breeze".*

"Oh god, this old story? Skip the telling,  
Aad I'll cut the yawns. We'll pull the  
Bbrk from out this willow, coz asprin's what  
Mmkes this tree worth felling, makes the  
story worth yelling".

*"Another telling, one more recount,*  
*I've heard the night from their perspective,*  
*I've seen their Ulapool and Bombard,*  
*but what I'm missing is your account".*

"My account is that which transpired,  
you know my glasses aren't good,  
it's just an enactment of events,  
That stays the same, that's understood'"

*"So you're saying all that was is all*  
*that happened? That she just woke up*  
*and she chose her anger?! That she*  
*just picked up that old hammer?".*

*She was sober, the straighest edge,  
a look would cut and see you dry,  
so let me affirm, that if I was you,  
I'd hedge your bets and I'd be through".

*"It's just you never talk about the thing,*  
*and it can't be the worst you've ever seen.*  
*I mean the death, the blood, and all the rest,*  
*how could this be the hardest test?"*

"You didn't see her eyes go wide,  
you didn't see her personhood,  
tuck its tail, to run and hide.  
You didn't see the beast confide.  
You didn't see what it had said,  
Imprinted on the fabric of her fate,  
I watched the second stumble, and then fall,  
Then crawl out scrambling for a gun.  
Any words to shoot her down,  
Anything to bring her back,  
To reach her ears or try to wipe  
Off that manic frown.  
But she didn't stop,  
She never twitched,  
She kept going as  
The scream lost pitch".

*"So what happened next?"*

"She drove her to the hospital".

*"Why does every story end there?"*

"They were cliché and they were seeing red,  
and clichés end when one's found dead".
