(Death by drowning:
Nameless, brainless, and without body.
My wet tongue scribbled down,
The continent I share with destiny)

Marg-e ghargh shodan:
Bee esm, o bee zehn, o bee tan.
Zaban-he khees-e man nevesht,
Ghareh-ye man ho sarnevesht.

I'm a puddle on the ground,
That conducts no heat,
But carries sound.

She's the solder on my tongue,
That died strung out:
One final rung.

She's the crevice in my heart,
The part that's prime to crack,
And split apart.

But at what toll.
And at what cost.
From coast to coast,
This island sunk.
