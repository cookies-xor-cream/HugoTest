Autoionisation And The Isoelectric Point: Walking Alone Is Sitting Still On Wheels

If the air around me was solid,
You'd see the claw marks digging through,
From out my body and into some
Liminal space slightly closer to you.

If you had thermal vision,
You'd see the heat as it fizzled,
Out from microscopic tremors,
Streaming to steam out the drizzle.

If you had barometer nerves,
You'd knows the pressure as it climbs,
From kPa to atmospheres,
Like a meteorological crime.

If you had gold foil to crack,
You'd see the static attack the film,
As I make a phase change from human,
And to the opposite of "I'm sitting still".

I'm gonna melt down the earth, make puddles from the floor,
If no one cracks open the flyscreen or my bedroom door.

I'm gonna burn me out, burn straight through my skin,
If I make a second attempt at being 'perfectly still'.
