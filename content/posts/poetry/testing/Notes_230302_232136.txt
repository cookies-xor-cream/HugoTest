Xanthile Hydration: Underdosing Insectiside

Coffee, coffe, on the wall.
Could I be the most fueled one
Of them all?

Coz Im not running on empty,
Im running on two hours oblivion,
And the promise of 10 bucks caffeine.
And as far as this week goes,
That's alright with me.

At least when I woke up today,
I was only slightly mildly dizzy.
And if you really got to know me,
You'd know that's the best that
I could do this week.

The only thing that should've kept me up,
Was my cut lip and tied up tongue.

But I can squak my beak straight through the shatter,
And it seems the former now has healed,
But not the latter.
