We've got a minute and an hour hand,  
but I need to count the seconds down,  
till I shake the spin and try to stand,  
and accustom to these vacant frowns.

Please stop festering the asking,  
please stop playing these games,  
I'm not looking for some tempest,  
that's going to need to be tamed.

For future reference,  
pick your answers from this list:  
Vacant,  
Vacant,  
Vacant,  
Vacant,

Vacant?
