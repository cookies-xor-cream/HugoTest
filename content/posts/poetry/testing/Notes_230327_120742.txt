Giving Up Means Meeting Halfway In Space And Halfway In Time

We've got a minute and an hour hand,
But I need to count the seconds down,
Till I lose dizziness and can try to stand,
And accustom to these vacant frowns.

Please stop festering the asking,
Please stop playing these games,
I'm not looking for some tempest,
That's going to need to be tamed.
