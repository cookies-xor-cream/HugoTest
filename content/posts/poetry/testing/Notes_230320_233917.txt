Egg Mayo Sandwich And Grenwich Mean Time: Scotland's Too Far Sweetheart

I want a routine, I want a set of steps,
But I won't meet you for a second time.
Please don't apologise, coz you didn't overstep,
I'm just cycling between the states of matter,
And I need to take my time.
I swear to you I'm fine,
But tonight I'm looking for a name,
That's spelt any way but 'mine'.

Wait Right Here Mr Nosebleed: I'll Run Home For Some Pads

You traded buckshots for a fawn,
And the straightest, fastest crawl,
To get me pads for my nosebleed,
Halfway through our forage for the dawn.

Coz I've bloodied my own face,
The thinking made it spurt in spades,
And I know that I'm not keeping up your pace,
But I'll be halfway down the road,
Burning out the stopwatch for this race.

You know this shit isn't a sprint,
And you don't have to tire feet,
I have plenty ink that I can print,
Whilst I clot and take a seat.

Can't Stomach The Body Or Thr Drink: Won't You Mix Something Sweeter, Honey

Come add your poison to this brew,
But you don't you tell me what it is,
I don't want to have a clue.

We'll drink it and we'll pass,
Then if we wake I'll promise you,
We'll make thid moonlight last.

I'll clue you me in and strap the seat,
And we'll all of the beaten paths,
Whilst we'll rip into the meat.

Coz I wanna see the fibres split,
Coz I wanna see the worst of it,
I wanna see it painted like a crime scene,
But god I'm burnt out on the grit I need.
