Coffee, coffe, on the wall.
Could I be the most fueled one
Of them all?

Bet I'm not running on empty,
but on two hours oblivion,
And the promise of 10 bucks caffeine.
And as far as this week goes,
That's alright with me.

At least when I woke up today,
I was only just barely dizzy.
And if you really got to know me,
You'd know that's the best that
I could do this week.

The only thing that should've kept me up,
Was my cut up lip and tied up tongue.

Though I can squak my beak straight
through the shatter,
Since it seems the former now has healed,
But not the latter.
