It's been a year or two, spent with a corpse,
that would always be rotting, but never decompose,
we pumped its body full of formaldehyde,
so the storm of maggots wouldn't pierce its hide.

I blurred away the past week or two,
was confused with not much else to do,
but bask in the mindset that I left me in,
stuck in a highlight reel that couldn't spin.
