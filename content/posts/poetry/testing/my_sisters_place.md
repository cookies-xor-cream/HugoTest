A little nightmare-locked,
In this tectonic ocean,
Where the plates glide,
And bump till they're disheveled.

I'm stuck in a benzedrine daydream,
And I drank the sky wonky tonight,
But this slope has got me,
Standing still like I'm still level.

Your window's looking pretty,
But it's stuck caught tangled up,
In fly screens what a waste,
Of the pretty and the gorgeous bevel.
