Something At The Bottom, But It's Not Nuance: A Less Ironic, Less Romantic Recount.

The Malaise Beat The Sarcasm.

I should've known by the strength of it,
That there was something at the bottom,
Some azeotropic mixed solution,
That didn't taste a league too rotten.

From "should've" to "did it" to promptly gone,
Upchucking one-word's length of swan song's calm,
I was once removed from under-hoof,
But try to find me now, I'm twice removed.

Coz I'm not staying,
And I'm not talking,
Know that I'm already
Halfway home. 

You can mumble,
You can stumble,
And you can try your
Best to groan.

This house is glass,
And we have stones,
And that's why right now I'm
Halfway home.
