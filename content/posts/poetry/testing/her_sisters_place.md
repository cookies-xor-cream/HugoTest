A little nightmare-locked,  
in this tectonic ocean,  
where the plates glide, and bump,  
till they're all disheveled,  
in one big lump.

I'm stuck in a benzedrine daydream,  
and I drank the sky wonky tonight,  
but this slope has got me,  
standing still like I'm still level  
enough to fight.

Your window's looking pretty,  
but it's stuck caught tangled up,  
in fly screens, oh, what a waste,  
of the pretty and the gorgeous bevel,  
we'll unscrew the thing posthaste.
