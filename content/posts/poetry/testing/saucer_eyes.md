Wherever you are,  
wherever you've been,  
look up and you'll know,  
that's the same moon  
that I have seen.

Beneath the stars,  
through light pollution  
of half-empty cars.  
you know it's the same  
reflection of the sun.

Whether waning crescent,  
or the waxing blues,  
depends on the overlap,  
of the nights that we  
both choose.

But I think just for one,  
that isn't quite as true,  
coz starry eyes, I'm sure,  
that this could only  
apply to you.

Look, dishrack face,  
your saucer eyes,  
are the constellation dots;  
the pressure points that fall  
across the glassy sky.
