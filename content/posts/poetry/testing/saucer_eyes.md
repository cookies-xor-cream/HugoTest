Wherever you are,
Wherever you've been,
Look up and you'll know,
That's the same moon
That I have seen.

Beneath the stars,
Through light pollution
Of half-empty cars.
You know it's the same
Reflection of the sun.

Whether waning crescent,
Or the waxing blues,
Depends on the overlap,
Of the nights that we
Both choose.

But I think just for one,
That isn't quite as true,
Coz starry eyes, I'm sure,
That this could only
Apply to you.

Look, dishrack face,
Your saucer eyes,
Are the constellation dots;
The pressure points that fall
Across the glassy sky.
