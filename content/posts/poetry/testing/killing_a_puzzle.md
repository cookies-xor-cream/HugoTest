If walking's a silver bullet,  
then it's only shooting me dead,  
coz the four to eight hours a day that I get,  
is only rearranging this puzzle in my head.

I think I'm missing a piece,  
but the water damage warped,  
every piece I tried so hard to place,  
pierced through my armour, and my guard.

And maybe with some time,  
the colours won't seem as stark,  
and instead they'll all gradient together,  
I think that's a good a place as any  
for me to start.
