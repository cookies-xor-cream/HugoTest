"Don't Be Hungover": Thought It Was A Funny Idea 

If we retroactively cut the drinking,
Would this ship we never built,
Unwind the clock and stop its sinking? 

I'm busy with the bottom of this bottle,
It's marked with an ex that I need to reach,
So load the nitrous and blast the throttle.

We're halfway out the breach.
