If I could move about not spatially,
But through the temporal medium,
I'd circumvent the past of me:
I don't wanna meet with them.

Take a calendar, flip the page,
Stitch two together, scry the thing,
A half dozen forward, watch me grow,
Then go back in time, and I'll rescind.

I wouldn't want to talk to me,
If I was a half decade out of date,
I recall that the past has bloodlet me,
And that nostalgia's sometimes overrated.

Shoot me then, or meet me now,
Derudder time's ship, blow out the bow,
If you're watching me you're blind to it,
But take a break, and it'll be stark.

(You'll watch blood dry,
you'll see the flood)
