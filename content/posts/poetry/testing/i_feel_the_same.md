If I could move about not spatially,  
but through the temporal medium,  
I'd circumvent the past of me:  
I don't wanna meet with them.

Take a calendar, flip the page,  
stitch two together, scry the thing,  
a half dozen forward, watch me grow,  
then go back in time, and I'll rescind.

I wouldn't want to talk to me,  
if I was a half decade out of date,  
I recall that the past has bloodlet me,  
and that nostalgia's sometimes overrated.

Shoot me then, or meet me now,  
derudder time's ship, blow out the bow,  
if you're watching me: you're blind to it,  
but take a break, and see it blown to bits.

(You'll watch blood dry,  
you'll see the flood,  
go write the story,  
you'll find out why).
