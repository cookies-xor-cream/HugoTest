She needed a reason to believe in
something past this planet,
but I prefered the notion that

*"Why do you think that there are stars?*
*Alien headlights, xenomorphic cars?*
*I think they're markers for where to dig,*
*A twinkle for celestial resource rigs"*

"I think they're excavated sites,
To show us where's been dug before.
That is why we trace the points,
To see how it is the faultlines joined"
