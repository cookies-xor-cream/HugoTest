She needed a reason to believe in
Something past this planet,
But I prefered the notion that
The sky could always shatter.

We've a glassy floor below
This china ceiling,
The ceramic doesn't
Lend so well to healing.

*"Why do you think that there are stars?*
*Alien headlights, xenomorphic cars?*
*I think they're markers for where to dig,*
*A twinkle for celestial resource rigs"*

"I think they're excavated sites,
To show us where's been dug before.
That is why we trace the points,
Since that is how the faultlines joined"
