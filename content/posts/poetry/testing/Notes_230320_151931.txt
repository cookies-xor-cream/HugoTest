Operation GlassHouse Birds: Someone Teach Them To Teleport

The only person that can (and would) cut my hair lives in fucking Edinburgh ugh.

If I had a dime for every call I dropped too soon,
I'd get a wishing well to wish you to this room,
Coz I've got scrawlings fading, and they're peppering my walls,
The only religion stood against the haunts in this old hall.

Hear me, listen, please, intrapolate my words,
Fuck the stones, just grab a shotgun, we've got ammo,
And this ain't less than a half-stone worth of bird.

I could always find someone to clip my feathers,
But I need to find someone to promptly cut my hair,
I swear to god I'm comfortable with anything,
And everything, but not okay with a stranger's hands up there.
