Her Friends Told Me My Contact In Her Phone Was 'Hope: If You Can See Us From Heaven, Watch Him Instead'

"Why are you staying the night?
What's the reason, and what're the ends?"

"I don't want to be with you, any more than you do,
But I made a promise that I intend to keep, and I made it to your friends".

"Funny, how they think you're the only person who can help,
And we both think you're the last one to think of or to text".

"You haven't said a word the past two sleeps,
What's it that had caught you and had dug you down so deep?".

"I never thought that I could miss someone I never knew,
But it hurts harder than you would know, god you don't have a clue".

"Move on Am, the past's not something that needs to cling,
Just think of this as a cut-short love, a simple 9 month fling".

She slapped me.
And then she laughed,
She hadn't smiled for days,
And hadn't steadied the
Tremor-hands.

"Don't speak like that, like you feel it as I can do,
This is something that lives, and breathes, outside and separate of you".

I did my job. We realised why I was here and not someone else:
It wasn't how close we were (we weren't).
It wasn't how we felt (we didn't).
It wasn't that she could use comforting (she didn't).

I was just the only person,
With such bad comedic mistiming,
To sneak in such a sarcastic joke,
Amidst all the (justified) whining.

She hated beating around the bush,
And the egg-shell floor tiptoes,
The constant wondering of how,
The subject matter comes and goes.

She needed someone,
Who wouldn't treat her like glass,
Who knew her well enough,
To know that she needed to laugh.
