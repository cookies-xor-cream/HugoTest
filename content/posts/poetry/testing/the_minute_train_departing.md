If you abled me to riftwalk,  
let my step travel through the clock,  
I'd take the offer, gladly, promptly,  
but I'd take it packaged with a glock.

We've got a target, we've got a bounty,  
we've got lasersights in stock aplenty,  
his name is 'who I was at sixteen' ,  
so let's load the thing and we can hunt me.

The world is made of cracks,  
and every caveat, and every crevice,  
is part of the single running track,  
of the minute train that we could  
never catch.
