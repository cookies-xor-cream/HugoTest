Consciousness comes once,
And then departs forever,
She forgot her tickets and
The bond of life lay severed.

We want to but can't touch the rail,
We all remember her absence,
Someone pull a heist and swap her
Ghost out with my essence.

The Minute Train: Departing For Platform 16

If you abled me to riftwalk,
Let my step travel through the clock,
I'd take the offer, gladly, promptly,
But I'd take it packaged with a glock.

We've got a target, we've got a bounty,
We've got lasersights in stock aplenty,
His name is 'who I was at 16' ,
So let's load the thing and we can hunt me.

The world is made of cracks,
And every caveat, and every crevice,
Is part of the single running track,
Of the minute train that we could
Never catch.
