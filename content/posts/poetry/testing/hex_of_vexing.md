The pension of recrudescence,  
like an inelastic tension strings  
us along with its bitter essence:  
through the ashy, sour tinge.

What's the escape velocity,  
to reach the land and forest fire,  
to escape this stormy sea,  
that can't seem to drown our pyre?

Tell me where, and I'll choose when,  
we'll find the dragon slumber-phased,  
singe the scales shed from disdain,  
to break us out of this smokey haze.
