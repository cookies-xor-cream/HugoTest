The pension of recrudescence,
Like an inelastic tension strings
Us along with its bitter essence:
Through the ashy, sour tinge.

What's the escape velocity,
To reach the land and forest fire,
To escape this stormy sea,
That can't seem to drown our pyre?

Tell me where and I'll choose when,
We'll find the dragon slumber-phased,
Singe the scales he sheds in his den,
To break us out of this smokey haze.
