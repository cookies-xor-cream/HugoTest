Pyroclastic Flow At Point Blank

I'm soul-deep steeped in suffering,
That's where my darkest humour lives,
Hiding in the paragraphs and curt remarks,
That are my filter and my sieve.

Coz pain without the irony,
Is nothing more than pain.
Just a senseless wanton violence,
With no comedy to gain.

The one thing that might dull the pain,
Converges on the one thing that I lack,
The panicked public breath attack in a
Not so subtle, nervous fade to black.

And I laughed a bit, I always do,
Beat my tendency to scream,
Like I'm shellshocked in a dream,
Like I'm ice-bath'd by the lava stream,
Of a flaring vagus beam.
