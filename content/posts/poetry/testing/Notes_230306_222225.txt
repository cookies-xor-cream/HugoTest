I Think The Answer Is Nothing (But Sometimes It Isn't): It's A Infinitely Thin, Blurry Line And I'm Not Going Remotely Close To That Shit For Months To Come

"My heart is made of glass, and it's already been smashed, I'd give all the pieces to you"
- a nice song

Would she steal my heart and take my hand,
Then find it out that our friendship stands,
On pillars of salt and on pillars of sand?

Fuck, I don't even know her name,
And it's not for lacking of asking,
But for the fact that she won't let herself be tamed.

Is it really that hard to mirror me,
To tell me back what she hears from me,
Her name, her age, or her nationality?

Well, I'm not so fussed, whichever way,
She plays this thing, I'm not looking for a game.

But she caught me in the gray.
And I'm caught up over thinking this assymetry,
But still don't know what we are,
Or what I want us to be?
