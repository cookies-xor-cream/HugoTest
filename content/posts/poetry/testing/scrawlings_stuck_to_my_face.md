I felt the same sombre kiss of rain,
that stuck close yet fell far away.
and I knew her mum would say,
that her friends are all holed up in their rooms,
whilst her daughter's laying, eating nails,
locked in a final resting place,
inside a casket in a tomb.

But I'm busy with my bloody arms,
I never meant to see the harm,
I was just looking for the marks she'd make,
since my skin's got practice covering the breaks. --
And the knifeplay was now gone,
dissolved inside the fading thoughts,
in the oceans of the memories of her life.

And if I had the potion or the book,
that the necromancer long since took,
I wouldn't wish her here this time.
She would only pattern me,
rebreak all of the splinters of my heart.
As if that would be a start.

And though I dropped out of the fight,
the minute I knew that she would leave,
my sanity's the swansong heist,
it's her final highlight reel.
crowned by a last artifact
of mine that she could steal.

I want to beg for the diary,
but I know it's not my place.
I just want to scribble out
the metal in this bitter aftertaste.
