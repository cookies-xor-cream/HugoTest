title: "Wait Right Here Mr Nosebleed: I'll Run Home For Some Pads"

You traded buckshots for a fawn,  
and the straightest, fastest crawl,  
to get me pads for my nosebleed,  
halfway through our forage for the dawn.

Coz I've bloodied my own face,  
the thinking made it spurt in spades,  
and I know that I'm not keeping up your pace,  
but I'll be halfway down the road,  
burning out the stopwatch for this race.

You know this shit isn't a sprint,  
and you don't have to tire feet,  
I have plenty ink that I can print,  
whilst I wait to clot and take a seat.
