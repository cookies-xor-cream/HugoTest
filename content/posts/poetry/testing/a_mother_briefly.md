"Should I be glad it went this way?
I could never raise a kid alone,
I know that's something I shouldn't say,
But I've been humming out her favourite tone".

I told her that she already had,
She shook her head and stroked her palm,
"That's not a dymanic that we should've had",
As I watched her struggle to stay calm.

"I just couldn't say no to seeing,
The idiot child crawl to my doorstep,
He found the way and he stepped through,
I never knew how to close the set,
How to finally be through with you".

I said you kept me dying,
All those months,
Asked her, isn't that
What a family does?

"There's much more,
You wouldn't know,
Or did things get better,
Back at home?"

I shut my mouth, I couldn't say,
How I felt about the gap,
That took her a decade away,
That gave us reason to stay at bay.

Instead, I set to calm her nerves,
Detangle history, and its seamed ends,
But what real purpose does that serve?
Does it absent the discourse we never sent?

I said I'm a seance, Amber,
A medium for lonely ghosts,
Do you still hear her timbre,
When you listen to my voice?

She started crying,
And sprung a leak,
So I kept the time,
And held her,
As she weeped

I told myself 'stay close',
For distance might offend.
Don't check your watch,
Don't count the seconds
Unill this thing can end.

But the only thing,
That could offend,
Was the thought that I
Thought of only me.

That I wasn't doing this
For my 'friend'.
