*"Should I be glad it went this way?*  
*I could never raise a kid alone,*  
*I know that's something I shouldn't say,*  
*but I've been humming all her favourite tones".*

I told her that she already had,  
she shook her head and stroked her palm,  
*"That's not a dynamic that we should've had",*  
and I watched her struggle to stay calm.

*"I just couldn't say no to seeing,*  
*the idiot child crawl to my doorstep,*  
*he found the way and he stepped through,*  
*I never knew how to close the set,*  
*how to finally be through with you".*

I said you kept me dying,  
all those months,  
asked her, if this isn't  
what a family does?

*"There's much more,*  
*you wouldn't know,*  
*or did things get better,*  
*back at home?"*

I shut my mouth, I couldn't say,  
how I felt about the gap,  
that took from us a decade away,  
that gave us reason to stay at bay.

Instead, I set to calm her nerves,  
detangle history, and its seamed ends,  
but what real purpose does that serve?  
Does it absent the discourse we never sent?

I said I'm a seance, Amber,  
a medium for lonely ghosts,  
do you still hear her timbre,  
when you listen to my voice?

She started crying,  
and sprung a leak,  
so I kept the time,  
and held her tightly,  
as she wept.

I told myself **'stay close',**  
for distance might offend.  
don't check your watch,  
don't count the seconds  
until this thing can end.

But the only thing,  
that could offend,  
was the thought that I  
thought of only me.

That I wasn't doing this  
for my 'friend'.
