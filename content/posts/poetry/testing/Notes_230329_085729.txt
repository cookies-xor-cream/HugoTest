Killing A Puzzle Of A Werewolf

If walking's a silver bullet,
Then it's only shooting me dead,
Coz the four to eight hours a day that I get,
Is only rearranging this puzzle in my head.

I think I'm missing a piece,
But the water damage warped,
Every piece I tried so hard to place,
Pierced through my armour, and my guard.

And maybe with some time,
The colours won't seem as stark,
And instead they'll all gradient together,
I think that's a good a place as any
For me to start.
