title: How Can Anyone Sleep When The Night Sky Is A Nail And A Hammer Shy Of Pouring Down On Us?

The stars are holes
that nails have made.
I'm stuck at the door
with knights and knaves.

Pick up the hammer,
and wait your cue,
I'll crack the riddle,
reread the rules.

Orion's a defective set of dots,
its belt pointing out
the structural faults.
