You know what, fair, I'll jaw the hook,  
a decade spliced is all it took,  
can my brittle teeth still take this bite,  
can they chew the bait, and leave the site?

A stanza here, or maybe two,  
did I grow me, or was that you?

I think we did it, wish you could've seen,  
who I was, and what I could be.

I'll write a cheque, take out a loan,  
to pay back the borrowed time I stole.
