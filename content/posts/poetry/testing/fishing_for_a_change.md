You know what, fair, I'll jaw the hook,
A decade spliced is all it took,
Can my brittle teeth still take this bite,
Can they chew the bait, and leave the site?

A stanza here, or maybe two,
Did I grow me, or was that you?

I think we did it, wish you could've seen,
Who I was, and what I could be.

I'll write a cheque, take out a loan,
To pay back the borrowed time I stole.
