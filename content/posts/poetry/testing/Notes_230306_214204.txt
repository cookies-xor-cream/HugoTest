The Hex Of Vexing: Cursing, Then Pausing

The pension of recrudescence,
Like an inelastic tension strings,
Us along with its bitter essence:
Through an ashy aftertaste.

What's the escape velocity,
To reach the land and forest fire,
To escape this stormy sea,
That's tempest plagued and out of phase?

Tell me where and I'll choose when,
We'll find the dragon slumber-tinged,
Singe the scales he sheds inside his den,
To break us out of this smokey haze.
