It's funny how I "rehash these things",
When I lack the beak for proper speech,
I'm eating the words I meant to speak,
A missile birdless, that never seeks.

I'm sorry, I know, I'm a bag of bricks,
But you know the saying of the stones and sticks,
We gutted us, then set us free,
But all we tasted was salty seas.
