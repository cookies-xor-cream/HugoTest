It's funny how I *"rehash these things",*  
when I lack the beak for proper speech,  
I'm eating the words I meant to speak,  
a missile birdless, that never seeks.

I'm sorry, I know, I'm a bag of bricks,  
but you know the saying of stones and sticks,  
we gutted us, then set us free,  
but all we tasted was salty seas.
