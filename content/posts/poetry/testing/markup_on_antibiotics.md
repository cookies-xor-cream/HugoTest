The malaise under my skin,
is crawling but stuck still,
the effort to try to breathe
is like running straight uphill.

I'm short now one draw,
and my throat has gone raw,
so if you find me the grate,
please pull it out of its place.

Coz it's stuck inside my chest,
and my lungs sleep bereft,
of the inhaling and the life
from which I'm coarsely deprived.

It feels like it's a set,
like it's a comical thing,
like the cosmic and karma,
have been pulling the strings.

It feels it like her eyes,
are staring daggers and knives,
it feels like the goodbye,
when she staggered her fives.
