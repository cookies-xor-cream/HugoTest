Projectile dunes and scattered sands,
Lay in silent wait, with idled hands,
Watch the skyline and the shifting floor,
Turn from silica and to armoured core.

The desert's a single loaded gun,
That's trigger-happy for some fun,
A whirlwind kicks up arid ground,
That aims for eyes, and eyes are found.

Religion's experienced within the wind,
That lets the dust from earth rescind,
If I were to watch the breeze pick up,
I'd find the ocean shore inside my cup.
