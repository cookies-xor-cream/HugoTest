Projectile dunes and scattered sands,  
lay in silent wait, with idled hands,  
watch the skyline and the shifting floor,  
turn from silica and to armoured core.

The desert's a single loaded gun,  
that's trigger-happy for some fun,  
a whirlwind kicks up arid ground,  
that aims for eyes, and eyes are found.

Religion's experienced within the wind,  
that lets the dust from earth rescind,  
if I were to watch the breeze pick up,  
i'd find the ocean shore inside my cup.
