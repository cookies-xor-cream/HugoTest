Old Timey Projectors With Little Joy Stamped On The Film

As hard as the past month was, I think the worst is over, and I'm happy it is.

It's been a year or two, spent with a corpse,
That would always be rotting, but never decompose,
We pumped its body full of formaldehyde,
So the endless maggots wouldn't pierce its hide.

I blurred away the past week or two,
Was confused with not much else to do,
But bask in the mindset that I left me in,
Stuck in a highlight reel that couldn't spin.
