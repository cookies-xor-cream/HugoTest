The Crow Always Flies The Same Straight Line That I Just Happened To Drown

One night worth of zopiclone,
Is all I need to reset me,
As the crow flies, or will have flown,
My sleep requires a parted sea.

Perpetual Motion Machine

If you stop the thing,
It'll never start,
Its heart is drained,
And short a spark.
