Markup On Antibiotics: $$$/5mg

Orchestration: I Feel Like There's Some Fundemental Irony Baked Into This Universe, And I've Been Coughing All Day After Talking About TB And Pneumonia Last Night

And Then My RAT Came Up Negative. I Love This Omnipresent Sadism.

The malaise under my skin,
Is crawling but stuck still,
The effort to tey to breathe
Is like breathing but uphill.

I'm short now just one draw,
And my throat has gone all raw,
So if you find me the grate,
Please pull it out of its place.

Coz it's stuck inside my chest,
And my lungs sleep bereft,
Of the inhaling and the life
From which I'm coarsely deprived.

It feels like it's a set,
Like it's a comical thing,
Like the cosmic and karma,
Have been pulling the strings.

It feels it like her eyes,
Are staring daggers, throwing knives,
It feels like that goodbye,
When she staggered all her fives.
