title: I Would Like To Like Hazel Auburn, But Don't (And Never Will)

She's got auburn hair and hazel eyes,
I bet a pretty name, but wouldn't know,
Namelessness is her disguise,
What it is, I wouldn't have a clue.

The inheritence of the nothing,
Is waking up with her Toyota's keys,
And the subtle nervous stuck-fast sting,
Of a nail in my head not far enough in.

Tighten the screws, get me a nailgun,
I'm not looking for a string of accidents,
Not searching for that type of fun,
And would like to think I'm not the only one.

But I feel how I feel, can't help out there,
And I feel nothing but the vacancy and
Oblivion stuck inside your empty stares.
Fuck, would I even dare? Do I even care?
