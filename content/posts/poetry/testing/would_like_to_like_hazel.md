title: I Would Like To Like Hazel Auburn, But Don't (And Never Will)

She's got auburn hair and hazel eyes,  
I bet a pretty name, but wouldn't know,  
namelessness is her disguise,  
what it is, I wouldn't have a clue.

The inheritance of the nothing,  
is waking up with her Toyota's keys,  
and the subtle nervous stuck-fast sting,  
of a nail in my head that's not far enough in.

Tighten the screws, get me a nailgun,  
I'm not looking for a string of accidents,  
not searching for that type of fun,  
and would like to think I'm not the only one.

But I feel how I feel, can't help out there,  
and I feel nothing but the vacancy and  
oblivion stuck inside your empty stares.  
Fuck, would I even dare to try to dare?

Do I even begin to want to care?
