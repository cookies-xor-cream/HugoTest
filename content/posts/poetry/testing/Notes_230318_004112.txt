Flourescence And Phosphorescence: My Skeleton Is Irridescent, And Hers Has Lost Its Sheen

I hope she's still glowing in UV or IR
I would hate to watch the shimmer fade

You know what they say
About the devil you know,
But keep it in mind I'm not
The devil you don't.

You can pick up the phone,
Or could hang up infused,
By the rage of my match
That ran down your fuse.

I know you're a halide away,
From being coupled and paired,
Packaged with a skeleton,
For me to take if I dared.

But I'm not so discrete,
I'm uncommonly found,
Next to the metals that
Are composing your salts.

Let's try out a blacklight,
A flouride-beam lamp.
Get me some black ink,
And a lead-weighted stamp.

I'll show you your matchbox,
And you'll play with the reds,
We're phosphorescent sweetie,
We still glow when we're dead.
