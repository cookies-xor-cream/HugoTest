I gathered the thread,
from the web that she spun,
I was an escapist at heart,
and I can't help but run.

And if the weaver's got silk,
then I'll pull at the yarn,
I'm gonna pull it all out
Till it tugs from the start.

We'll deweb the spider,
and watch as she swings,
we'll count up the thread,
it'll grow as she sinks.

Then I'll sew you a dress,
that's got two-fold the limbs,
I know it's made of your core,
but please bear me the sting.

And it'll cover your shell,
and won't let you see air
no simple diffusion,
but I swear that its fair.

And we'll rename the gown,
could we call it a jar?
Don't forget to inhale but
your breath won't draw far.

And when you can't draw a breath,
when there's no oxygen left,
I'll jot down the time,
we'll be announcing the death.
