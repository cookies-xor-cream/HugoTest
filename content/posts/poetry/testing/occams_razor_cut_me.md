If Living Is Even Something Someone CAN Pay Back

Neutralize this acrid acid,
Discard the remaining alkali,
I don't know whereat the trust is,
It's caught in the pauses,
between your sighs.

I know just why you can't believe,
It's for all that time I've ground my teeth,
I wanted speak, but caught my words,
So they fell fast, and went unheard.

I wish I chose to tell you sooner,
But now that I have bid my timeØŒ
You've conjured self-obsessive rumours,
Stories that you won't leave aside.

Different rooms,
And grocery bags,
I went for laundry,
To wash her rags.

I went for locks,
To which I Iacked
The keys that would
Promptly set her back.

I needed to pay this back
I only went to set her free,
It's the simplest story here,
I wish that was something
That you'd see.
