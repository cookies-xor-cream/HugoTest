If Living Is Even Something Someone CAN Pay Back

Neutralize this acrid acid,  
discard the remaining alkali,  
I don't know whereat the trust is,  
if not caught in the pauses,  
between your sighs.

I know just why you can't believe,  
it's for all that time I've ground my teeth,  
I wanted speak, but caught my words,  
so they fell fast, and went unheard.

I wish I chose to tell you sooner,  
nut now that I have bid my timeØŒ  
you've conjured self-obsessive rumours,  
stories that you won't leave aside.

Different rooms,  
and grocery bags,  
I went for laundry,  
to wash her rags.

I went for locks,  
so that she'd lack  
the keys that would  
promptly set her back.

I needed to pay this back  
I only went to set her free,  
it's the simplest story here,  
I wish that was something  
That you'd see.
