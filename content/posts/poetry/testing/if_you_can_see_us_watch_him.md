*"Why are you staying the night?*  
What's the reason, and what're the ends?"

"I don't want to be with you, any more than you do,  
But I made a promise I intend to keep, and I made it to your friends".

*"Funny, how they think you're the only person who can help,*  
*And we both think you're the last one to think of or to text".*

"You haven't said a word the past two sleeps,  
What's it that had caught you and has dug you down so deep?".

*"I never thought that I could miss someone I never knew,*  
*But it hurts harder than you would know, god you wouldn't have a clue".*

"Move on Am, the past's not something that needs to cling,  
Just think of this as a cut-short love, a simple nine month fling".

She slapped me.  
And then she laughed,  
she hadn't smiled for days.  
She hadn't steadied her  
tremor-riddled hands.

*"Don't speak like that, like you feel it as I can do,*  
*This is something that lives, and breathes, outside of*  
*And entirely separately from you".*

I did my job. We realised why I was here and not somebody else.  
It wasn't how close we were *(we weren't).*  
It wasn't how we felt *(we didn't).*  
It wasn't that she could use comforting *(she didn't).*

I was just the only person,  
with such bad comedic mistiming,  
to sneak in such a sarcastic joke,  
amidst all the (justified) whining.

She hated beating around the bush,  
and the egg-shell-floor tiptoes,  
the constant wondering of where,  
the subject matter comes and goes.

She needed someone,  
who wouldn't treat her like glass,  
who knew her well enough,  
to know that all she needed was to laugh.
