Scrawlings: Documented Proof I Was A Fucking Idiot (I Still Am), Only A Fucking Idiot Would Feel That Way

I loved walking in the pouring rain. It's so sunny here. I know the sky can't be so fucking happy all the time. Sometimes I wish it was brave enough to admit that.

I felt the same sombre kiss of rain,
That stuck close yet fell far away.
And I knew her mum would say,
That her friends are all holed up in their rooms,
While her daughter's laying eating nails,
Locked in a final resting place,
Inside a casket in a tomb.

But I'm busy with my bloody arms,
I never meant to see thd harm,
I was just looking for the marks she'd make,
That had repaired since my skin's too fast to cover all the breaks. --
And the knifeplay was now gone,
Dissolved inside the fading thoughts,
In the oceans of the memories of her life.

And if I had the potion or the book,
That the necromancer long since took,
I'd see her for a while.
Maybe then she'd pattern me,
Rebreak all the splinters of my heart.
As if that would be a start.

And though I dropped out of the fight,
The minute I knew that she would leave,
My sanity's the swansong heist,
It's her final highlight reel.
Crowned by a last artifact
Of mine that she could steal.

I want to beg for the diary,
But I know it's not my place.
I just want to scribble out
The metal in this bitter aftertaste.
