Her Sister's Place: Fuck, I Put Her Car Keys In My Pocket By Mistake

I was 20% sure I got the house right. But 20% wasn't enough for me to encroach on a stranger with 80% certainty

Guess her toyota's hostage to her drinking now

A little nightmare-locked,
In this tectonic ocean,
Where the plates glide,
And bump till they're disheveled.

I'm stuck in a benzedrine daydream,
And I drank the sky wonky tonight,
But this slope has got me,
Standing still like I'm still level.

Your window's looking pretty,
But it's stuck caught tangled up,
In fly screens what a waste,
Of the pretty and the gorgeous bevel.
