I'm the vacuum of a person,
found in every missed rehearsal,
and every sentence said out loud,
we mispunctuated with our frowns.

I'm the sole prayer for my absence,
I'm the lack thereof my presence,
I'm pneumonia trapped inside a bottle,
I'm the accelerant and indulgent throttle.

Flay me, skin me,
secede this being,
if it's worth the crease,
then it's worth the seeing.

Dogear my page,
I'll set the stage,
so strain my soul:
pressed through this cage.

Orion shot me,
and ursa reaved,
they purged my soul,
with cosmic sieves.
