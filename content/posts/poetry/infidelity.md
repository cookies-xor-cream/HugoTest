*"If you kill me I won't call it murder,*  
*It'd just be self-relief".*

*If I kill you I would call it blood-lust,*  
*But not one that I would grieve.*

"You have flayed me but don't you stay me,  
I've got less than room for two".

*"If I knew what I had done then,*  
*You'd say that wasn't true."*
