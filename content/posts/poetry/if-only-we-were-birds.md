"Tell me why then I  
am last to bed  
but the first woken up?  
Should sleep concede,  
when you guide me  
through paragraphs  
I've hardly eyes  
to read?

Tell me then,  
are we crows  
or just desert hens?  
For in our wings  
we catch ink and pens,  
but unclear it rings  
if we could ever fly  
with them".
