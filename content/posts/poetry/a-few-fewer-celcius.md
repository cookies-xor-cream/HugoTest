The sky was once so cold at night,  
to nip the desert heat that bites,  
but I bide my time and bid farewell,  
and freeze inside the searing glare.

Of all the notions I can't seem sell,  
I most of all miss the ice clung air,  
the sealess stare of seam-filled rocks,  
that lack the water to fill their clocks.

But now I live by seaside straits,  
by salty water that solely hates,  
the things I need, and tends to take,  
the things I need, to try to break me.

From ocean view to desert streets  
that I've walked along but couldn't find  
where heaven meets this heat.
