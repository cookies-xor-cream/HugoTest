I've founded far worse homes  
in far worse states than that  
in which I've found myself before.  
I need to write a thank you note,  
but I can't remember who to write it for?

My body's a rental and the proof  
in it is that instead of gone or missed,  
it sits quietly out of place.  
With none in need of it,  
for it'll be slowly,  
and eventually replaced.

Know that I can see the glimmer,  
Of flittering hopes caught in  
the eyeline's simmer, that found  
itself sitting cinched into a lake.  
But now has its gaze,  
drifting quietly out of place.

Between the plumes of smoke and  
the hazy rules, Hazel votes for feelings forged  
in circumstance I can't attest.  
In her hands too close, and mine sat  
swatting them quietly out of place.

Under the streetlight where the stars connect,  
I'd tell you that I hate you but I've little  
courage to be direct.  
So I'm sitting here and sinking,  
hope inching quietly out of place.

You're burning what you wrote me,  
like a candle lit as votive, is all the  
pain that you might show me,  
strung and wrought into a ghost,  
bleeding quietly out of place.

And face to face, then wrist to wrist,  
I'll grip the hands I may dismiss,  
though I despise what I might miss,  
I'll hold the silence on my lips.  
It's curled and tucked inside my fist,  
seething quietly out of place.

I'll stay, then wile the night away,  
below the starry sky that cannot stay,  
whilst each point sits, and waits its turn,  
to fade quietly into place.
