I threw up all my words last night,  
gonna take a little break,  
guess that I won't write.

Think I've exhumed the static confluence,  
breathed out the poison with its essence.

If I couldn't pry my mouth to talk,  
then I wouldn't even have to try,  
but I have to find a way to walk  
from my door to bed tonight.

Slept harder and better,  
than all fucking week.  
time and its passage  
got caught in my sleep.

I Didn't dream and didn't nightmare,  
it was just a blackened splash of sable screen.

Four long, short, hours of happy.
