Take me out to where you're at home,  
I want a day that's lived out through your eyes,  
an omen of the fights we'll one day have,  
a forecast with fire in place of ice.

You speed my heart, but cool my head,  
steady nervous hands trapped in frantic shake,  
we've lightning trapped between our skin,  
and we've got the parts to try to make,  
and to birth, a monster from my sins.
