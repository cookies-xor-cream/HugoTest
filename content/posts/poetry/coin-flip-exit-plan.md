She's the corpus of a spirit,  
she's a smear of the past,  
she's a hollow shell of  
what she inherits at last.

She's the lack of a battle,  
she's the chorus reversed,  
she's the carapace of  
the finish to a quieter verse.

She's my pinch on her chin,  
she's a record stood still,  
I think that that's fine  
but I wish she would spin.

She's a 10 minute walk,  
she's a flower in wilt,  
she's definitive proof  
I need something to sip.

She's her eyes on my face,  
she's a wrinkle in time,  
she's the anachronism  
that we're flipping the dime.
