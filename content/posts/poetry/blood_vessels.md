(This one's so happy,  
but I write them all gray,  
just know the colour was there,  
before it got flayed).

My head's gathering blood,  
coz I was sleeping downhill,  
the park was eerily calm,  
frozen so perfectly still.

I wanna red out my eyes,  
join my flow with the trees',  
like capillary branches,  
all withered, deceased.

There's something in my skin  
in my ulnar veins and arteries,  
a blockage that doesn't exist,  
stealing my head out from under me.

My veins were endodermic,  
now they're digging up roots,  
birthing feet first feeding blood,  
this shit's so sanguine and crude.

I found my pulse in my wrist,  
please put it back in my chest,  
I've got the signs I'm alive,  
don't need a beating reserve.

Been a month since it spiked,  
at least in a bad way I guess,  
do I want it to slow?  
And if so should he profess?

Now, he's trying to speed,  
since my pressure fell low,  
but the break's in my head,  
so my heart will happily go.
