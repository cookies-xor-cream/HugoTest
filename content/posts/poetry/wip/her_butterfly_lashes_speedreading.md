She reads like it's a task,  
Like osmosis through a page,  
A by-proxy panic attack,  
Found through paper and a pen.

She fell off the face of this dull earth,  
I asked her why she'd want to stay away,  
She told me that she fell in love,  
Thought some time apart would calm her heart.

There was something in the way your eyes fluttered around the space,  
Only to find themselves in a nesting, sitting idly perched upon my face.
