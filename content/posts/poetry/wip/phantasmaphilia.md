God I hate the second person,
It implies I'm not alone,
But I'm conversing with a ghost,
With a grave of rotting bones.

And I can hear them hollow out,
Hear the screams as maggots bite,
Hear the timbre eaten up.
See the leucine all bleed out.

I'm addicted to the future,
You're enamoured by the past,
With you digging at the sutures,
We could never make this last.

Wait for this final flight to find
The ocean where it lands,
We're gonna crash into the water,
With our arm in arm, and hand in tired hand.

And you'll leave it with the funeral,
But I'm skipping it, for we both know,
Sadly, that I can't.

I found a spectre, I'm enthralled,
I'll resume post-mortem from these walls,
Send eidolons 'guised in the breeze,
In the windy fall and easy winter freeze.

All this weather you perceive,
Is birthed from a phantom's misery,
Folding creases on your face,
Like Igneous rock sent touring outer-space.

Though this volcano's angry now,
Still know Io-you like a cow,
In a Promethean fantasy,
You're Ionia prying the shackles off of me.

The self's a bridge that we burned down,
In rejection of Mazlow and his crown,
And now I'm waiting in the queue,
Where the youth line up to drown with you.

And we'll stay till the sunset starts to break,
Till Terra starts its violent shake,
And though I'll be missing from your side,
Don't be scared, you need not hide.

I will catch you in a sunbeamed dawn,
Made recipient to a blinding gaze,
Draw sunburns 'cross my face,
Solar rain'll wipe my vision from its place.

I don't need eyes if you're not here,
They could never be of use,
When my field of view's constrained,
With this headstone obscuring me from you.
