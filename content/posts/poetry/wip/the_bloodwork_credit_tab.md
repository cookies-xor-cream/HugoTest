I finally lost the bruises that I picked up  
when I planted my hand out on the street,  
I suppose that plant couldn't grow inside my pockets,  
which was dry in the rain, dying discrete.

I watched the blue and black blur,  
turn back to a beige-tanned receipt,  
I guess they couldn't find the sunlight
from denim concrete that refused to recede.

Hand me an eraser, I'll whiteout the veins,  
then hand me a pencil, I need them replaced,  
I know I can't move them too far,  
I just want them downwardly displaced.

You say I'm too happy, I think I'm happy enough,  
you say that I'm jaded, but my life isn't that rough,  
you say I need plumbing, for the bloodwork gone wrong,  
I think my pipes are in order, as opposed to your tongue.
