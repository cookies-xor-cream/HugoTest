She got a visit from a dying stork,  
And in this game of cosmic chess,  
They had caught us in a fork,  
I gave up both queen and equus,  
Got a ten buck champagne bottle,  
And watched you pop the cork.

You've gone nine months without drinking,  
I'd tell you that I was proud,  
But it seems counter-productive  
To say that shit out loud.
