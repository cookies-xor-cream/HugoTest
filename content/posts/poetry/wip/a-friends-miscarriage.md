She got a visit from a dying stork,  
and in this game of cosmic chess,  
they had caught us in a fork,  
I gave up both queen and equus,  
got a ten buck champagne bottle,  
and watched you pop the cork.

You've gone nine months without drinking,  
I'd tell you that I was proud,  
but it seems counter-productive  
to say that shit out loud.
