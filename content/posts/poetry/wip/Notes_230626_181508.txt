This way, Azrael don't got leverage.

"The problem with getting attached is that it makes me want to stay. Ezrāyeël don't wait".

"I told a friend and she said that people can survive terminal illness".

I got a chuckle in response, "honestly, I hope I don't. I'm happy having had the chance to dot the i's and cross the t's".

Permanent Departure

In the absence of your union
You say the solution's dissolution,
But I'm disillusioned by the hue,
Of the rampant purple runway,
Bruising up and down through you.

And if we can't fix an exit,
Then we'll stay in and we'll sit,
We'll get Danish butter biscuits,
Count the minutes spent in illness,
Till the time stamped on your ticket.

Coz I'm in it for the finish we expect,
Not the one we played-pretend,
Not the one that we'd rehearse,
So however it might end,
You'll find me at the final bend.

And when nothing else can matter,
We know reality has shattered,
When we're both as mad as hatters,
We'll give chatter to the reaper,
So go on up and greet her.

We're in her fanclub, retroactive,
Though we're scarcely Abrahamic,
And I know I'll one day meet her,
But it's your turn, now be seated,
Enjoy the flight.

We booked out the whole damn aisle,
So you're sitting alone and window-side, 
Where you can hide, and dream of home,
Good night.

Ezrāyeël, That Psychopompous Fool

Euthanasia's what I had in mind,
When I asked if I could stay the night.
Don't worry dear, on my way out,
I'll make sure to hit the lights,
Good night.
