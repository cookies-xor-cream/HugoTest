Life's a function for destruction,
It's the parameterisation of chaos,
Into a spatiotemporal reconstruction.

If time's the input then we can put
The clock in our peripheries,
For none to read, but all the output see.

I'm hunting for patterns in that noise,
Some definitive fundamental peak,
Of this Fourier transform.

And though the image never sets,
I found a recursion in the string
That's stuck on infinite repeat.

And I'll compress it into words,
With the frequency dispersed
In the gnawing of the gadfly curse,
Delivered exactly as rehearsed.
