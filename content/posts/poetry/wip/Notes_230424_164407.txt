Her Cat-sitting Produced A Witness

You don't need a prophylactic for a chronic ill,
but the paroxysm that makes your heart stand completely still.

I asked her why we were on her strung out on the floor,
she said that she needed to be calm, to feel like she was alone.

When she locked her door I buckled,
and she lost her breath to a playful kind of chuckle.

Told me that I need not worry,
placed something in my hand, in exchange for a bedtime story.

So I indulged her and I swallowed it,
I'm not a weaver but I can try my best to knit.

So I sat with her the night, and I laid it out all flat,
with all the plotholes and the missing details,
whilst we were staring down the cat.
