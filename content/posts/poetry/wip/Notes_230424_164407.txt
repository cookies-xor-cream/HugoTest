With Her Friend's Cat As My Witness

You dont need a profilactic for a chronic ill,
But the paroxysm that makes your heart stand still.

I asked her why we were on her bedroom floor,
She said that she needed to be calm, to feel like she was alone.

When she locked her door so I buckled,
And she let out her final breath in a playful kind of chuckle.

Told me that I need not worry,
Placed something in my hand in exchange for a story.

So I indulged her and I swallowed it,
I'm not a weaver but I can try my best to knit.

So I sat with her the night, and I laid it out all flat,
With all the plotholes and the missing details,
While we were staring at the cat.
