My breathing stopped,  
my heart kept rhythm,  
a metronome clocking out,  
barely able to slither.

It snaked from side to side,  
I counted every tick,  
I had a few more left,  
before I'd get sick.

So in turn it stopped,  
to leave a beat as slack,  
petrification in place,  
of the bravery that I boldly lacked.
