Isn't It Offensive That The Sun Rises On Corvus Every Fucking Day?

I wrote "I wanna wake up tomorrow" in sharpie on a all in the city. She saw it and said it reminded her of me. Well, that's because it was me. I'm glad someone still loves the world enough to interrupt their bus timetable with an unscheduled and spontaneous reading.

One can only stare away so much ceiling,
It's still gonna come pouring down and raining.

One can only give glance at so many stars,
Before they evaporate in the morning's amber light.

One can only fall so in love with corvus,
Before he's stripped of feathers and of corpus.

Please untether me with a four-week notice,
Of all these mortal things and follies made.

I resign my position as a thing of being,
I retract my morning and give up my name.
