Sunrise As A Sin

One can only stare away so much ceiling,
It'll still come pouring down and raining.

One can only give glance at so many stars,
Before they evaporate in the morning light.

One can only fall so in love with corvus,
Before he's stripped of feathers and of corpus.

Please untether me with a four-week notice,
Of all these mortal things and follies made.

I resign my position as a thing of being,
I retract my life and give up my name.
