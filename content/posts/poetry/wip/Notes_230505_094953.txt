The Infinite Teapot Can't Count To Two With So Many Decimals In The Way

Reals Are Dense In The Set Of Rationals

I got an invitation for some tea,
Which I felt I must firmly decline,
But in a walk before the morning broke,
I found her granddaughter sitting in the park.

We talked a few hours, in a midnight haze,
She speaks the same tongue from the same town,
Feels like finding a sister that's been so estranged,
And forgot her frown, as the sky plastered up the dawn.

I've got a placard like a blanc cheque,
I used to move eastwards for the sun,
By the end she felt less like a friend,
And more like addition to the one.
