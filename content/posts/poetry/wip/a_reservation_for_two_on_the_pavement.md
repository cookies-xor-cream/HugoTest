I caught her on the curb having already blazed through a whole cigarette,  
Thought she went in for a kiss, but hooked my heel to sweep me off my feet,  
Jested that she tried to waltz with me, but it seems she had missed a beat.  
I counted two, meaning me hitting the concrete made it three complete.

It seems my favourite things are ketamine and one week long relationships,  
I need someone to knock some sense into this hollow fucking skull,  
Don't worry about reducing my IQ, it seems that I am already left with none.  
But if you don't want to hurt me or have some righteous self-importance,  
I don't mind a drink so that we could maybe meet to mull it over once.

But it'll be over after that.

Over, because bar some twist of fate or intervention of divine intent,  
Over is all I'll let it be come monday morning the coming week.
