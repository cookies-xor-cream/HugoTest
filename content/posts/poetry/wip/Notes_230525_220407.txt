Ferrum, Measured Volumetrically

I wish so badly I could tell her:  
I've thought about you every day  
For the past thirteen years,  
But the truth is that I haven't...

I can't tell anyone that story,  
Without sparing all my tears,  
Without seeing the Amber light,  
Tunnel gummed with fear.

She wasn't even the B-side,  
To these past few years,  
Of a patched-up life, to this  
Empty song of strife I've here.

Pale as a ghost, I watched  
Her cough up blood enough,  
To take her from anaemic to  
Ferrous enough for the litres lost.

I watched her pale and sickly,  
While she saw my full recovery,  
As she was teasing, edging Azreal,  
Giving life for me, as currency.

She bartered with the devil,  
And so the demons stole her soul,  
I watched her slowly fall from grace,  
Turn from diamonds back to coal.

I was there only for the company,  
In her dreams of death and asphalt,  
As they seeped throughout her nightmares,  
And sprouted fissures in her heart.

We don't know when you'll die,  
But mortality's definitive,  
If I had any more inside of me,  
Then I'd give, and give, and give.

And when I lay here, finally emptied out,  
I'll keep on digging, for something more to give.

If there's anything that I might have,  
Then it's there for you to steal it back.
