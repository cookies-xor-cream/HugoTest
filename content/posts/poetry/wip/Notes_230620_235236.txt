Oh what'd you do to cygnus,  
That she's merely a machine,  
She's an insignia, a symbol,  
Of what she used to be.

I remember coalescence,  
To be singular in pain, in vain.  
Like a crane made up of vertebrae,  
Tripping over, slowly going lame.

What's in her label, if not her essence,  
Do you feel her vacant nameless presence,  
In this abstinent drawn out, persistent,  
And if you feel it so, then is it consistent?

It's not a hit, or miss,  
My head won't make the distance,  
With this anachronistic heart  
Putting up so much resistance.

It's not a palm, or fist,  
But the hothead's catching fire,  
Do we join to play this ritual?  
Do we acquiesce the pyre?

"Arya, what the fuck is 'we', don't make me third wheel this. Just practice saying the word".

*"With all due respect, and irony: no, I'm really okay".*
