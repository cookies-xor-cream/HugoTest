Her Daughter Used To Do Way Too Much Ketamine On That Table, Now You're Eating Croissant's On It With Her Ex's 'Fling' (I Want A Break. This Suburb Is, And Always Was, Nothing More Than Poison. It Seems Despite The Toxins, Some Still Near Their 50s Beautiful)

I shouldn't've mentioned I'd be here this Wednesday. You sat with a coffee and an assortment from a shitty patisserie, waiting for me to arrive.

Her mother was loitering outside on their garden table, she looked like she was living but I know she only just survived.

I haven't seen her in a while, but she looks the same she did last decade and it caught me with my guard down. And she fucking shattered it with a hug that lasted way too fucking long.

I'd cry, aunty. I would. I just don't know if I have any tears fucking left in me anymore.
