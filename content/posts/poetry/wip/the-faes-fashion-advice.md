"Fuck, you wore it *that night*, didn't you?"

You asked me where I got this hoodie,  
upon remembering, I felt the implication,  
you asked me if it harboured any ghosts,  
I didn't like that insinuation.

It still fits me like it did eight years ago,  
you said the green doesn't seem quite like me,  
and I countered with a question of my own:  
*"How does that make you feel: at home?"*

She started crying over the ghost,  
of an ex of an ex, or whatever she is  
I suppose?
