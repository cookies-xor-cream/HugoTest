"Fuck, you wore it *that night*, didn't you?"

You asked me where I got this hoodie,  
Upon remembering, I felt the implication,  
You asked me if it harboured any ghosts,  
I didn't like that insinuation.

It still fits me like it did eight years ago,  
You said the green doesn't seem quite like me,  
And I countered with a question of my own:  
"How does that make you feel: at home?"

She started crying over the ghost,  
Of an ex of an ex, or whatever she is  
I suppose?
