I found you in the wake of apocalypse,
Mummified, bandage-clad inside an abyss.
I guess that this was just the unmaking
Of the deliverance of an existential curse.

You were in the bathroom painting pink,
You were lathered in his blood from when
You went picking out his veins with a
Fresh freezer-frozen knife.

And I fucking hate how you feel safe with me,
It's not any testament for restraint,
Just the lack of the blood-lust found within.
