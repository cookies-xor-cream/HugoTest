This is pain for the sake of pain and hands for the sake of hands,  
An object of a jealousy for that which he never had the chance,  
And I'm happy to comply, but it's been teo days since the funeral,  
And you have sandwiched us, asking to be a mural on the wall.

We're objects of envy in touches with motive of resentment,  
He's in my head with the first page of a book doting on intent.  
I think you should slow down, that grief nullifies your consent,  
You don't get to ask for much between death and phobos of lament.

It's 6pm on a weekday and you've reached halfway down the bottle,  
The only thing waiting at the bottom is a regret speeding at full throttle,  
And if you want a crash, some automotive circumstantial happenstance,  
The least you could do is take it easy until you can stand away from me.

It feels like playing ventriloquist with the shell of a girl,  
Pretending she's not empty of life, decked with gemstones and pearls,  
But I know it better and you know that you must know it best,  
Like a KK thesis written on the epistemology of chasing detest.
