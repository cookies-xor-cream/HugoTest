Kindred: No Existence But Relative
Consanguineous Hypocrisy

I swear to god the paradoxical self-parody
of this self-fulfilling prophecy is getting
a little out of hand,
but the supply axiomatically equates to the demand.

It is for it commands,
and it declares for it has regal thoughts
intrinsically, like the shifting sands of
an oasis mid-desert mirage.

It's nothing if it isn't its own self-obsessed homage.
