If our lives were just a dream,
Then you could grab me by the collar,
And reel yourself
Slightly closer in.

I would want your warmth
To boil the water from my face,
But this is all the heat I'll ever
Feel or ever face.

Coz these 36 too few degrees,
Is all the fire stuck inside of me
When in the absence of a kiss
I wouldn't miss

You asked me how long that it had been
But that questions pointed, locked and loaded
And the answer leaves you disappointed
Coz the only circumstance, well...

Coz the only circumstance
Where I'd receive the touch,
Is with a flyscreen stuck
Between the two of us.
And I know that sometimes that can't be enough.

So I don't think that this thing is gonna
Work out between me and you,
Just look me in the eyes and tell me
You dont think that too
