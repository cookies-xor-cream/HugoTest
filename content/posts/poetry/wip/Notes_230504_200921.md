I'm Glad Portugal's A Hell Of A Walk, Coz These Roses At Doorstep Have Me Worried That You're Out On The Prowl

Every concession that I never made,
Has been clawing at my chest,
Like a cough that never tastes my lips,
That instead lays dormant and repressed.

Fuck tension, this is torsion,
Of a cataclysmic proportion, 
I'm a table that shouldn't stand,
Without another rope to hold my hand.

So pin me up onto a cross,
Coz I've worn it far too long,
To know there's some conversation,
In which I might belong.

I've been at home for far too long,
I miss sleeping on your canap√©,
But since then it's been refurnished,
And there's nowhere left to lay.

I hated these four wall,
Missed sleeping with the comfort,
That you were a hallway door away,
On the off chance rapture erupted.
