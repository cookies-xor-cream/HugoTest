Every concession that I never made,  
Has been clawing at my chest,  
Like a cough that never tastes my lips,  
That instead lays dormant and repressed.

Fuck tension, this is torsion,  
Of a cataclysmic proportion,   
I'm a table that shouldn't stand,  
Without another rope to hold my hand.

So pin me up onto a cross,  
Coz I've worn it far too long,  
To know there's some conversation,  
In which I might belong.

I've been at home for far too long,  
I miss sleeping on your canap√©,  
But since then it's been refurnished,  
And there's nowhere left to lay.

I hated these four wall,  
Missed sleeping with the comfort,  
That you were a hallway door away,  
On the off chance rapture erupted.
