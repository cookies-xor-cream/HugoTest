I'd Rather Reason For Hate Than Hate By Default

When I tell stories
I miss the details that make me cry,
Like the bitter salt inside my drink,
Or the morbid thoughts that have me
Teetering at the precipice of the brink.

I've been as far off of this ledge,
As you can be without falling off the edge,
And I'll hedge my bets on a naloxone shot,
That I mistook for an epipen.

I dont know if either of you read a single one of these. But I feel too awkward for a thank you individually?

It didn't make me feel any differently to be heard tonight, but it made me happy not to be victimised.
