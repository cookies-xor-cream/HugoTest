Was My Heart Just For Decoration?

It's funny to read these old things back,  
So long here after the fact,  
It's funny to see how the sky can crack,  
But fossilise to stay intact.

If I could cull my thoughts, I would,  
Not for the falsity that I think of you,  
But to fabricate a bad excuse  
For a heart that tried at what it could never do.
