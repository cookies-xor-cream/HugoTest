When you go, come back again,  
haunt me, please possess me,  
take my body to head-height water,  
then watch me drowning in the sea.

I want to watch a murder,  
like the massacre at KHole Bridge,  
spent half an hour treading river,  
I guess that that's my only niche.

I know I've killed a part of me,  
but not in any single place,  
I left them in these k-hole graves,  
scattered along the way.

I think alive leaves a lot  
in the warpath of its absence,  
I'm gonna miss your wake,  
but you say they all speak nonsense anyway...
