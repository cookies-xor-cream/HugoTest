Riddled With Holes: Life By A Thousand Cuts

Someone culled the morning whilst I was fast asleep.
I suppose that twilight is close enough to morning,
I suppose that it bridges the vacancy?

If I could bottle twilight,
And not wake up again,
I would make a coffee,
And then would go to bed.

It'd be another cavity,
An addition to this vacancy,
To the riddling of the nullity,
That is fully comprising me.

An existence made of holes,
It's porous to the touch,
How much can you cut out,
Until it's not enough?

I just wish this language had
Only one more synonym,
To stand alongside 'empty',
To convey the void within.

For I often feel as if
The opposite of full,
Is the only remnant thing
That which I am at all.
