Grass Is Greener Syndrome

It's obvious that flower dreams of wood,
And they would leave behind their bloom,
Trade in the floral for an arboreal-fated doom,
A sacrifice and transaction made too soon.

It's obvious the mongoose dreams of ease,
Of some semblance of a quiet peace,
Where the snakes hide out in dormant fields,
And dream, trampled, herbaceously under-feet.

So why can't I seem to even try to dream,
I'm an afantasiac sewn out the seams.
The green looks gray on every side,
Does grass die outside-in or inside-out?

Someone help me inflict myself,
With some dizziness or vertigo,
I can't seem to want to reap,
All I can ever want to do is sow.
