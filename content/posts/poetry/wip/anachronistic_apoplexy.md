This plexiglass has got fibres in it,  
asbestos things putting the fire in it.  
fire me down, or fire me up,  
flare me up, then put me out.

I'm about to have a stroke,  
I've got a fit of apoplexy,  
as dated as myself, I suppose.

I would document this month,  
so much fucking better succinctly,  
but I can't help but be verbose,  
so kill me, leave me some remorse.
