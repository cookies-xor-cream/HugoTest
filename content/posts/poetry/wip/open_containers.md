She asked me how,  
I did so many, so bad,  
all lined up back to back,  
with no stutter and no lag.

I told her that its easy,  
that the infractions of a person,  
aren't contagious or in season,  
but they're isolated treasons.

She said that he'd tried it out,  
but his partner cheated,  
he lost his will, gave up his heart,  
had never been so defeated.

It's times like these,  
I'm thankful I've no memory,  
that I forget the very thing,  
I'm looking at in front of me.
