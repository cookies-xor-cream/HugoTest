If I could bottle twilight,  
And not wake up again,  
I would make a coffee,  
And then head to bed.

It'd be another cavity,  
An addition to this vacancy,  
To the riddling of the nullity,  
That's left fully comprising me.

An existence fully made of holes,  
It's so porous to the touch,  
so how much can you cut out,  
Until it's not enough?

I just wish this language had  
Only one more synonym,  
To stand alongside 'empty',  
To convey this void within.

For I often feel as if  
The opposite of full  
Is the only remnant thing  
That which I am at all.
