Whatshername Didn't Need A Sequel (And I Wish Her Sequel Didn't Try So Hard To Be My Friend, I Hope They Give Her A Desk Far Away From Me)

After an onslaught of miscellaneous chest pains
And weird side-eyed stares at her silver dolphin necklace
I finally got my third fucking coffee,
You finally got fucking rid of me,
Now maybe either (or both) of us
Can be at some fucking peace.
