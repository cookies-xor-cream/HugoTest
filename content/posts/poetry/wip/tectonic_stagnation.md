You're afraid only of earthquakes,
But I am equally afraid of the earthstills in this unilluminated city.

We were protest of this suburbia's
Scarcely spilled out street-side lights,
That lay in idle wait on concrete feet,
For the erosion of the night.

I have a neon heartbeat,
That's less a vital sign,
And more a nervous tick
That's falsely advertised.

Don't read the signs,
They're lit-up lies,
Empty psalms that say
That maybe I'm alive.

In the absence of all faultlines,
I found tremors in my being,
Composed not of their existence,
But of my reluctantly resisting.

Like a denizen of death,
That desperately persists,
I'm scared that I'll diminish,
If we divorce this tryst.

In the slipping of the faultlines,
I found the epicentre was loving you,
I would say that we are through,
But it feels more like you're a through-and-through.
