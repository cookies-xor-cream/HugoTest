Indebted, Infinitely And Forever

She owns me, has my spirit,  
I exist only for her kindness,  
But I'm shaken, scared, that I'll  
End up leaving in her likeness.

She owns me so completely,  
Not like a mother owns her son,  
But by the parallel of how  
Apollo possessed the sun.

She owns me fucking wholely,  
Not like I'm just an accessory,  
But if she would've liked to break me,  
That would've been just fine by me.

For however long the moon might glare,  
This bitterness will never seem so fair.

For however long the sun might burn,  
It could never cleanse this hurt.
