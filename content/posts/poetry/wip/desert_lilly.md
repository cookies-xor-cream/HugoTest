Every modicum of sense strapped to me,  
tells me I'm an idiot to want to do it,  
but the disconnect between my thoughts and words,  
feels like lying a little bit.

I'm told to listen to my better sense,  
I'm told the omission is excusable,  
and I'm happy where I am, I'll stay,  
but this isn't a lapse, isn't exhumable.

And the ethanol could use a reduction,  
by a methyl group, or maybe two,  
coz the poison on my optic nerve,  
or in my stomach would keep me far from you

I'm not out looking for anything more,  
I just wanted to be crystal clear,  
that we can let this plant bloom,  
or leave it to wilt downwards here.
