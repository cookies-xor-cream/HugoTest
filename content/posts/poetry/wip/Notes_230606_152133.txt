Sleeping At The Music Department: There Wasn't Enough Room For Both Of Us To Lie Down, Except On Top Of Each Other.

To strut, and to fret,  
To stupor, and to hear  
How she nailed the wailing,  
Made my blood clot,  
Frozen in the fear.

She left me vein-less,  
Standing here in vain.  
I could hear her screaming,  
Manifesting all her pain.

It was a strange night,  
At the end of an even stranger day,  
And we found ourselves locked overnight  
Inside the music room backstage.

Locked there inside the darkness,  
Sitting firmly back to back,  
The same way I sat  
Inside K's closet.

But like a bad dream in reverse,  
We talked the sun out of its slumber,  
And then you forgot the entire night,  
Almost like a sentence that'd been served.  
And I saw you then no longer,  
Fuck, that's not what I thought  
That I deserved.
