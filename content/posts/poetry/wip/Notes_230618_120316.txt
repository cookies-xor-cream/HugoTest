Chemical Clocks With All The Wrong Types Of Chemistry (We Ran Out Of Ceasium)

"If I wasn't born your sister, then nothing could be explained.
And as such, it's such a fucking shame that fraternity can't keep me sane.

But I would give my life in siphon if you might need a violent drain.
I would meet a mouth filled with sulphur if it would titrate away your pain.

I just want to manifest a mixture, synthesised to buffer,
Some alchemy to stabilise the person you could offer.

All I ask for is a rewind to a final night out on the curb,
It would be just me, and you, and we'd both be alone with her.

And as such, it's such a fucking shame,
Coz however much I wanna bleach this slate,
The fact of the matter is set in stone to stay,
Either I came a decade early, or you came a decade late.

And as such, it's such a fucking shame,
Why'd you come a decade early?
Why'd I come a decade late?".
