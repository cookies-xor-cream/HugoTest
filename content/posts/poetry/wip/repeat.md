Fuck the tunnel of white,  
the light I want at the end,  
is the rosy beaming afterglow,  
from the taillight of her car.

And I know that I should ease it in,  
that I should be shielding my eyes,  
but I don't care, no I'm going to  
stare straight into that fire.

If it's between that picture,  
and the sprawling city lights,  
I would always pick the former,  
coz I fell for it too hard.

Tell me that my vision's broken,  
twice as skewing as my thoughts,  
but I won't listen to a word,  
no, I need to play this part.
