Strangers Again

I cry to all the songs that which,
I miss the point of so blatantly,
If I had any strength left in my wrist,
I'd hang onto the meaning that they have,
But all the effort I had to give away
This month, already has been had.

I've got a life sentence
Worth of evidence
Buried beneath my desk,
And the carpet's pulsing,
Tethered to the tell-tale heart
I've got wrapped up in my chest.

My ribcage weighing down,
Starts to creak like floorboards that
Warp their wood in light at dawn,
Each pump of blood is long since gone,
But I think I have pressure enough,
I can force away this final frown.
