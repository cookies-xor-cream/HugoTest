The Weather That Sunk A Continent

Theres no amount of verbiage,  
There exists no phraseology,  
That can suck up the enjambments,  
Until I haven't an encore left in me.

But there's topics I abhor,  
Avoided for fear of retaliation,  
Of the parry and riposte,  
Of taking water coast to coast.

The first's the frantic frenzied phase  
As courier for pensive apprehension,  
Of how she thought me tightly wound,  
And sought to release the tension.

But tell me sweetheart, what are you,  
If not a bundle of butterfly stomachs,  
Of shaking hands, and quivering lips,  
And bruising grips placed upon your  
Thorax, to infinitely sit?

You hit like a deafening ecstasy,  
But so do half of all my friends,  
So listen sweetheart, hear you me,  
If you fucking care you'd dissolve  
Into the breeze, and see to it this ends.
