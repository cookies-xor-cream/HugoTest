She Moved As Suddenly As She Decided To...

Im sorry you saw me, but I'm happy I came,
Wouldn't be the same without it, so let's divy the blame,
The next that I visit, I'll be skipping the wake,
They plaster on smiles, are so fucking fake.

I'm sorry my werewolf, that lunatics wane,
Im sorry the Eid broke the plans that you'd lain,
But that was the last visit to your hospital flat,
Next time crawl out the window, and meet the pavement flat.
