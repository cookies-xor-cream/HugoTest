If it would wash away your pain, then bid a warm welcome to the fray,  
Sorry that I'm always staring at that little slit that sits dismissed,  
That little cut that found its fixture placed to live upon your wrist.

Sorry that I'm awkward, I just need to watch my step,  
I've never climbed but you have scaled a dozen steps.  
I don't want to make you fall, you're gonna hit your head.

And if you die down here, here at the base of this flight of stairs, it ends tonight. Youâ€™ll be nothing but a point on a list of a glossary of those one-night type of things.

You'll leave as quickly as you came, with the taste of blood stuck to your tongue and disdain quietly having found its place inside those empty eyes.

I shouldn't have said hello, I don't want to say goodbye.
