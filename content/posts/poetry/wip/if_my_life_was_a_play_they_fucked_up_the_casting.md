There's a sparkle in her eyes  
that isn't in mine,  
but it gifts me with a seizure every  
once in a seldom while.

There's a breath in her lungs  
that isn't in mine,  
but I pretend that I still exhale  
just fine most of the time.

There's a pulse in her chest  
that was ripped out of mine,  
but I can't be bothered to  
miss it all the time.

You can be the queen Oberon,  
and I'll play a midnight Puck.  
We're in a midwinter nightly tempest,  
but we don't give the slightest fuck,  
we believe that we deserve it.
