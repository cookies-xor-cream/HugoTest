I'm sorry you saw me, but I'm happy I came,  
wouldn't be the same without you, so let's divy the blame,  
the next that I visit, I'll be skipping the wake,  
they plaster on smiles, they're so fucking fake.

I'm sorry my werewolf, that lunatics wane,  
I'm sorry the Eid broke the plans that you'd lain,  
but that was the last visit to your hospital flat,  
next time you can crawl out the window,  
and meet with the pavement all flat.
