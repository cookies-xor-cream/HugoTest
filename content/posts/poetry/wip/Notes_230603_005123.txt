Polynomial Regressions Of Exponential Concessions

The Lagrange Form Of Remainder For Arbitrarily Large t: The Asymptotic Limit Of Quotients Of Subset Complexity 

My silence is my confession,
But the volume of your whisper
Is a marker for regression.

You're my ego, I'm your id,
A sigil for the animus that
You forgot that you had hid.
