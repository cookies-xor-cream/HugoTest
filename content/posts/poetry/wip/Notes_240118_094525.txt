Photodischromisms At Barotraumatic Depth

I love the games under the canopy's shelter from last night,
I love her sable hair and the awkward canid way she bites,
How she flips the script, the way the tables always turn,
How it seems she has up both her sleeves a fable or a tale.

How the moon chases the sun, to donate its vestige solar light,
A little palid glimmer shot onto the edges and peripheries of the night,
How it brightens her face, that softly lit exemplar of celestial grace,
How it hastens her eyes, that camera with the ISO set all the way down.

How we can't play cards for her eyes don't work quite alike to mine,
All the time she spent in twilight, you'd think her rods would adjust,
But I suppose that nightvision must be a birthrite, not a bloodrite,
All this balancing of reactants got away from me.

Guess we splashed the film with some heliocentric, solipsistic tendencies,
And now it can't quite see in the lighting that you'd find at the bottom of the sea.
