A Kiss Like An Embalmment

She said the only reason she agreed,
Was this abyss she found herself within,
She was in it completely and solely on her own,
With the notable exception of my hand to hold.

Whatever sentiment was inside that kiss,
I couldn't feel it, it must've fallen off your lips,
But maybe the sentiment is more of a guilt instead,
It's your infidelity, so why does this feel like my regret?

I swear that her lips are full of formaldehyde,
Because I embalmed a little when I died inside
In the aftermath of this romanticide attempted.
Where I felt nothing, but she felt everything, just latent.
