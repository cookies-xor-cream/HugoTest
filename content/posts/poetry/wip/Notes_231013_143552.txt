Enblaming Immutuality

Good openings:
No
I'm actually married

Bad openings:
I live alone, if you would like to...
I'm not doing anything on Friday night

She said the only reason she agreed,
Was this abyss she found herself within,
She was in it completely and solely on her own,
With the notable exception of my hand to hold.

Whatever sentiment was inside that kiss,
I couldn't feel it, it must've fallen off your lips,
But maybe the sentiment is more like guilt instead,
It's your infidelity, so why does this feel like my regret?

I swear that her lips are full of formaldehyde,
Because I embalmed a little inside
In the aftermath of this romanticide attempted.
(Where I felt nothing, but she felt everything, just latent).
