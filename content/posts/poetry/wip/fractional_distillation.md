I hate you so, dear,  
but I'll still beckon you hither,  
like the last freeze of the winter  
that makes me pleasantly shiver.

Like the first bloom of the spring,  
or the last undressing of autumn,  
like foliage falling from filters,  
as they're shedding their cotton.

But you're a midsummer night's shower,  
that has turned fetid and rotten,  
so pray tell to me dear,  
now that you're flush with this power,  
why are you flooding the flowers?  
Why do you instil me with fear.

Does it feel good  
to know you can tower?  
Does it feel good  
to distill me until clear?
