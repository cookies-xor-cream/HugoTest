"Gorgeous, we must be so voltage gated,  
Coz the potential got lost in the axon,  
Now I'm short some zapping on the dendrites,  
Can you put the static back inside?

You put the -us in nuclea-us,  
Without you it's formless,  
Not a noun.

You're a helix in duplicity,  
I want to prefix you di-,  
And I hope you do so,  
But do so inside.

Coz as much as I want my words  
To coincide with your suicide,  
My hands are tied, and not the noose,  
And it's not because I haven't tried,  
My battered soul, my jaded muse".
