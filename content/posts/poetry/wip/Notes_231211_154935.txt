The Bars Of This Self-Imposed Prison Are Leaving Tanlines

What kind of escape is it anyway when it's from that which recurs,
Like an exodus from "cast in cement" to "in a slightly bigger cage",
Well what difference could it make if you could see beyond the walls?
What use is skin if be run rugged in an even sunburn afterall?
