I felt the right wrong end of a DUI,  
she had a hell of an afternoon,  
and I was just trying to pass her by,  
but she got out, slurring like a sailor.

She asked if she had hurt me,  
but I caught the car at walking pace,  
whereas she would end up in heaven,  
if she chose to complete this race.

And so I set the terms and conditions,  
and when the ink had dried, we agreed,  
she gladly accepted my offer,  
to park for her, so we struck the deal.

She promised me she'd get home safe,  
and then she asked me for my number,  
so she could buy me a coffee to make it up,  
but if she tries, I'll decline the offer.

I wasn't exactly close to eager,  
I could hear the voice echo,  
"VƒÅi Ar, you sure know how to pick 'em",  
so I think I'll let this go.

I'm bad with speed right now.  
I think I'll take this slow.
