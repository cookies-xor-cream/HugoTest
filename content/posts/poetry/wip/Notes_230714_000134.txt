Alyriscian Pistolsickle

I'm starting to think I can't die the same,  
But I guess that's for Saturday to say,  
Sweetheart if you can please pierce the veil,  
Resurrect as a fury, and smite me for my blame.

I want to see a firework lightshow,  
I want to see this sapling-thorn grow,  
Then root dormant in the passageways  
On the backside of my hand just stitched in place.

I swear it's like a trigger for the nerve pain,  
For dying flames that icy veins so crudely feign,  
And in that vein I ask for a trigger-happy pointer finger,  
To see this hair-trigger twitch and flicker.  
Tease the gun and watch it shiver.

Death is not so well delivered  
from an alyriscian pistolsickle.
