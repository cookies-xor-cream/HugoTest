Evicted, redacted, got my deal struck and rescinded,  
Talking, or crawling, either way's perfectly fine,  
She's on floor 4, can you hear it now calling,  
You said "come in, be at home, pour yourself a glass,  
And then pour me two more, I need me some drinks,  
You're exciting and I'm such a fucking bore".

Maybe it's the bottle of whatever we're drinking,  
I doubt that it's water, but I want now to test that,  
So please hand me another.

This is where she lives, but you're living a guilt trip,  
So we're stuck to your bedframe, where the rug slipped,  
And painted the carpet red.
