Quieter Means And Dimmer Places

My heart's not climbing up my gullet,
And my head doesn't harbour hurt,
Im not looking for someone,
To sit with me out on the curb.

Think after eight hours of reading
Through legislature,
This is what I needed:
A full blown sensory recession.

Even though this room's got
An abundance of fluorescent light,
My eyes are rested well enough,
To withstand the photons as they bite.

A Requiem For Curbing

It's not really missing a person
If there's alternatives to company.
All the words and affirmations
Won't buy you any currency with me.

The only thing that matters
Is that we're in a quieter place,
Somewhere where sound can't
Reach our supraliminal space.
