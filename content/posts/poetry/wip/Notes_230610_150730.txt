Filling In The Gaps

I wound up on a call with Amber,
Not quite sure what to say, or do,
Or what exactly I should think of her.

I wound up asking for a story,
In the most broken, shattered French,
And so she detailed me her history,
A lifetime lived inside a trench.

Pari had company, and her hearing's good,
So we talked in Farsi, and Dari,
And anything she wouldn't have understood.

She told me that she lived in Beirut,
And got here earlier than I did,
But she was still trying to grow her roots,
Wherever they might snare or slip.

She wasn't fussy, she wasn't looking for much,
Just looking to try to get a grip strong enough.

And the call devolved to teen delusions,
A woman scarcely in her 20s,
Living through voluntary fantastic confusion.

She told me I could ask her any question,
That there was no limit to what she'd answer,
Except for our shitty internet, and worse reception,
But I didn't know exactly what I should then ask her.

My head trifled through a filing cab,
Of all the conversations that we missed,
Every exchange that we had never had.

"Why'd you do it?" no, that's not right,
"What was the intention?" left me apprehensive,
"Why put me through it?" had too much bite,
And "Why'd you miss me?" was a tad too pensive.

So it went quiet, and the last I heard,
Was "I love you", so I hung up,
And I saw the phone at hand returned.

But Pari wasn't keen on freedom,
She wasn't planning to let me leave,
And though my every fibre was primed to run,
I found myself couch-bound and sitting still.

She told me she wanted a souvenir,
So she put on some music and she begged,
"Your party trick. I want 8 bars here".

And I hate to deliver,
But I hate to disappoint,
Luckily my hate was burning,
And so I was poised...

I gave her an elegy,
To take off the edge
Dulled but not diluted,
To reel me off this ledge.

I gave her a stanza,
In a call and reply:
The form of an answer,
That fizzled, then fried.

The words, half burnt,
Were all I could spend,
Though so brief and so curt,
They're all I could rend.

And I was probing for reaction,
For some violence, whether found
As action or as inaction.

But she asked to be held,
And she wrapped up our hands,
And in reluctancy's meld,
She said "if I breathe then you can't".

I think that I'm not gonna miss her,
That I'll miss her kid so much more,
The adorable way he fidgets,
And the cutest way that the toddler snores.
