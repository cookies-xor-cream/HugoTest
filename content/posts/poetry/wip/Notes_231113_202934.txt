My Heart Never Skips A Beat With Her

My resting heartrate is breaking triple digits
But I suppose it's not really resting strung out on you.
Why am I always so fucking anxious
When there's the slightest chance that plans might fall through?

Thought I was over and out,
But I'm down for the count,
Please ignore me my dear,
Don't know what I'm rambling about.
