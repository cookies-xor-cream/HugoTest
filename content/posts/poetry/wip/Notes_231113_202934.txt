Two Hours Into A Conversation And I Can't Recall A Single Thing You've Said (Sorry. Call Me Sometime I Don't Need An Active Distraction)

My resting heartrate is breaking triple digits
But I suppose it's not really resting strung out on you.
Why am I always so fucking anxious
When there's the slightest chance that plans might fall through?

Thought I was over and out,
But I'm down for the count,
Please ignore me my dear,
Don't know what I'm rambling about.
