A Movie Where Every Frame Is The Same Picture

The same night, on repeat, with a different person each time. It's infinitely better with a friend than with a stranger.

My life is prismatic,
Fucking fractalesque,
Each slice is self-similar,
And shares its essence.

I'm afraid if you
Hand me a knife,
I'd the release the tension
From my tendons,
And the salt from in my eyes.
