Anachronistic Apoplexy

This plexiglass' got fibres in it,
Asbestos things putting the fire in it.
Fire me down, or fire me up,
Flare me up, then put me out.

I'm about to have a stroke,
I've got a fit of apoplexy,
As dated as myself I suppose.

I would document this month,
So much fucking better succinctly,
But I can't help myself but be verbose,
So kill me.
