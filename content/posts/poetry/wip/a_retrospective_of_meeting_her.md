Think, don't think,  
She takes rejection  
Without dejection,  
Or infractions acted.

If her abjection  
Could be exorcised,  
I'd drink it straight  
From through her eyes.

For the lack of acting  
Is aptly put as respect  
Found never lacking,  
And always understood.

And respect makes  
My 'no' turn right around  
Into an answer that's  
That's more 'yes'-bound.
