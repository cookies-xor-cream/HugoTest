I got an invitation for some tea,  
which I felt I must firmly decline,  
but in a walk before the morning broke,  
I found her granddaughter sitting in the park.

We talked a few hours, in a midnight haze,  
she speaks the same tongue from the same town,  
feels like finding a sister that's been so estranged,  
and forgot her frown, as the sky plastered up the dawn.

I've got a placard like a blanc cheque,  
I used to move eastwards for the sun,  
by the end she felt less like a friend,  
and more like addition to the one.
