"If I wasn't born your sister, then nothing could be explained.  
and as such, it's such a fucking shame that fraternity can't keep me sane.

But I would give my life in siphon if you might need a violent drain.  
I would meet a mouthful sulphur if it would titrate away your pain.

I just want to manifest a mixture, synthesised to buffer,  
some alchemy to stabilise the person you could offer.

All I ask for is a rewind to a final night out on the curb,  
it would be just me, and you, and we'd both be alone with her.

And as such, it's such a fucking shame,  
coz however much I wanna bleach this slate,  
the fact of the matter is set in stone to stay,  
either I came a decade early, or you came a decade late.

And as such, it's such a fucking shame,  
why'd you come a decade early?  
why'd I come a decade late?".
