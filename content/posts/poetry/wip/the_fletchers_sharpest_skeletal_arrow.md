To jet, to dart,
To puncture,
Nothing could
Obstruct her.

Not head, not heart,
Not conscience,
Not the pulse chained
Within my chest.

But everything that's
Made to end a life,
Guarantees blunting,
When it executes its mark.

I'm your parchment,
And you're my foil,
You complete me but
I only see you spoiled.

Of wood, and feathers,
You're those two joined,
But metals make up
The sharpest points.

If I have got for you a wishbone spare,
And it's still got a wish stuck in there,
I'll play the fletcher, and fill the air,
With pointers on avoiding stares.

Metal may be sharp,
But breaking bones
Can punctuate despair,
More than ferrous things could know.

Either way, death's eyeline bleeds,
It found and struck you out the trees,
With all the premeditation born
Inside the saliva of an archerfish.

I can't give you what you want,
Or give you anything at all,
But if you are scared to fall off from
The bondage of this mortal coil...

Well,
Then I'd be happy to ascertain,
It's done in pairs, and not alone.
We don't bury friends, no,
The living only bury bones.
