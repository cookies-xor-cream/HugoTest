You came out the dark, glitter sparkling on your face,  
Adorned in smudges of concealer and faded lipstick stains,  
And now you're lost to the night, missing in action by her side,  
I don't think that I can bottle the pain, it evacuates with my breath,  
Escape with my side-eye and the seething in my stares.
