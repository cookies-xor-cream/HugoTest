The Sound Of A Butterfly Drowning

She's the carapaced carcass of a lost vertebrate in water
No matter how I clap my hands, they'll never catch her.
She doesn't want to be caught, she's a victim to the flow,
She found less freedom in agency than in solving the Navier-Stokes.
With a needle through her brain, her thorax is all that's left in tact,
The twitching isn't a sign of life, but a meticulous facade,
Her wings flap victim to the current, and not her illusion of choice,
Her autonomy has been excised in favour of a palatable voice.
