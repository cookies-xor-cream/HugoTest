She actually made the call today,  
but she was slurring still,  
you know that if my heart was a house,  
you'd find me straddling by the windowsill.

Because a reply of my acceptance,  
for her to buy me coffee,  
was a date planned as a penance,  
and that's not enough for me.

I'd rather have handed you back your car keys,  
so you could finish what you started,  
take a couple shots, return,  
if only to have killed me.

Or rather, killed yourself.
