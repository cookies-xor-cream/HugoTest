*"She loved that*  
*Eulogy that You*  
*Don't remember*  
*Even writing.*  
*Hung onto*  
*Every word,*  
*And every*  
*Paranormal sighting".*

"It takes  
Just a word,  
To find the start  
To a story,  
I won't breathe  
Newfound life,  
Into a long-dead  
Anthology".

*"Write her back,*  
*Just a single letter,*  
*I see 'thank you',*  
*In pause on your lips,*  
*But I know it can't*  
*Be meant for me,*  
*So must be aimed at*  
*Something better?".*

"That's how it starts,  
I did a year apart,  
To get that wrench  
Out the clockwork  
Of my heart,  
I couldn't take  
A restart, we can't set  
This straight enough".

*"I got a sorry note,*  
*A 'happy birthday'*  
*That she had*  
*Chronically misspoken,*  
*And it made me*  
*Start to think that*  
*Maybe she's just broken?".*

"I compartmentalise  
Way too fucking well,  
Like I'm a vendor and  
This is the hardest  
Fucking sell.  
But I was never  
Going to invalidate  
My ticket out of hell".

*"She was hell?",*  
*'Hell is where*  
*You put it',*  
*"But have you*  
*All the space,*  
*For a realm below*  
*This stagnant plane?"*

"I'll find a way to fit it".
