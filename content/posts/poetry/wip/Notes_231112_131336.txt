Manualunar Photoescapism And Attachment Issues

I Had Attachment Issues, She Had A 9am Shift, And So When The Sun Woke Up The Moon Was Suddenly Not So Bright Anymore

The moonlight absconding strung scarce and receding,
Ensnared in the valence between our ring fingers.
So I saw the gleam scuttle, just to sputter then die,
Wish we redacted the glimmer with some shadows of mine.

So I suggested to you that the gaps in your hands
Would fit so neatly in mine by request or demand,
The response flickered in courage like an old bedside lamp
But you mustered the connection to plug into my hands.

And as we sat in the park, the moon stayed besides,
Afloat in the sky, protesting passage of time,
From now till forever, it has chosen to stay,
And I pray to the sun that my lamp does the same.
