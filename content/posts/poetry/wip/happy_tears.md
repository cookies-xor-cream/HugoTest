I love the rain, just want some thunder,  
I'm more comfortable when my sleeves are longer,  
so I wore my shirt, but that's a blunder,  
the first layer's all I need.

But if you could scrape off a few degrees,  
I'd be so happy, wearing long sleeves at ease,  
I don't want to see the veins stuck in my forearms,  
I want them to leave me be at peace.

An old lady caught me crying on the bus,  
said her husband died, and the book I had,  
reminded her of a time where she'd say *'us'*,  
but that's stuck generations back, within the windy heights.

I meandered my way home,  
found the path of least resistance,  
because I was locked in daydream fugues,  
long enough to make the distance.
