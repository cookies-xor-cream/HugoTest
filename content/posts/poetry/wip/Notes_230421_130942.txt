Why Would Anyone Put The Drunk Comedy Of A Teenage Me On Their Chest

It was late and blurry and for whatever reason I wrote across her with a marker.

She saved it forever. I fucking hate that.

"Whether alone, or with kin,
we're all in queue for the
existential recycling bin".

Her shoulder had a pair of scissors and a dotted line,
As if a beckoning 'please amputate me',
To remove the scrawlings on her arm,
Like the scribblings were less a string
Of bad decisions than a set of written scars.
