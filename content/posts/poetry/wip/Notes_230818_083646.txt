I Only Have One Controller, But The Dead Don't Move Their Fingers So Fuck It What Do We Lose Out On?

"She left these for you, they have writing on the back [...], Arya, you don't want to keep these?"

She handed Steph a set of polaroids,
They're of her enamoured by her boy,
And him playing with her hair.

She thought that I might like these pictures,
Though she knew that I'd prefer
A snapshot of her sutures and lacerations.

She said that she would let me see in person,
Some time in the far-off distant future,
But it seems we'll never reach that day.

This is a co-op game and it looks like
We're down by a single player today,
(The other one went on short notice,
On a permanent visit to a far too shallow grave).
