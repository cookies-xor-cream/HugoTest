A Polaroid Of A Photocopy Of An Image That's Been Compressed

Sometimes I feel like a copy,
Like a polaroid of a polaroid,
With every snap getting more blurry,
Closer to blank and null and void.

Well we upgraded to a DSLR,
But can't beat the compression,
We'll only make it three trips far,
Before we feel the separation.

The image bleeds,
Chooses surrender,
Lines and boundaries cede,
As they both tear asunder.
