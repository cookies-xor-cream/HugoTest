Anxious But Tries To Never Worry About Anxiety

She doesn't ask me stupid questions
Like 'are we happy or complacent?'
'Are we withering in our place?'
And 'should I give you extra space?'
Like 'are we weighted to the seat
Or our growing dismal vacancies?'
Like 'are we reactive or inert?'
Like 'am I helping, or are you being spent?'

If all you do is think, you can only think about your thoughts,
And if all you do is worry, then stress is all you're stressed about,
But by its design overthinking's not so eager to dismiss,
We think badly of our misery, but calm might lead to boredom,
And I'm living testament that boredom comes with risks.
