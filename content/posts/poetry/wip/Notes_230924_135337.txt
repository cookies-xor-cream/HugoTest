I Feel Like A Paperweight

I spent a chunk of the morning roaming around,
My eyes dodging the brickwork, glued to the ground,
I'm scared to look up, buildings are so easily tall,
Whereas after only 2 decades, I'm beginning to fall.

A foundation's only a floor and the base,
It doesn't account for all of the vertical space,
If you tear it down quick, the building hardly will fall,
You'll just take off a storey, from the story you've got.

Structure's left as the scaffolding's role,
It's the flesh and the wire, capillaries, bones,
All the physical things holding extremities close,
But mine wither with wind, and they weather with time.

So when the time comes to pass,
And the turbulence swept me away,
I'll be a hollow carapaced corpse,
Just a big paperweight.
