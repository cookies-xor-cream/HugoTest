You are him but come in skin that don't quite listen with a tongue that don't quite talk,  
You are everything that you can be that I am always not, a careful ploy at anything but mutual.  
You are a bad attempt at custody of friends, a feigned politeness sprinkled over hate,  
You are a bitterness conflating this headspin of a life with a habit of chaining cigarettes.

If you want to smoke and fizzle out, if it's cancer that you're so dead set on chasing,  
I haven't any right to stop you, that's a choice that you have a freedom in contracting,  
But I'm infinitely afraid of being in a room alone with you which lacks the vacancy for air,  
I'm scared of standing with my shoulder to your shoulder, closet-bound to a 7 minutes spent in hell.
