I can try my best to hold this posture
just long enough not to shatter glass,
but please don't show me the flash,
I'm not sure I can make this miracle last.

There's still a black smear on my eyes,
from when I looked at the eclipse,
and I think I burned through my being,
but im more concerned with my wrists.

Because my bones have been fusing,
stuck permanently concatenating,
four, to two, to one, to none,
slowly sinking, quickly wrinkling
up in time.
