Early Everywhere I Go, No Thanks To Transit

I'm Gonna Scream At This Old Lady So Hard, They're Gonna Bury The Both Of Us

Sorry For Screaming, It's Just If A Car Had Hit Me Today, I'd Fall Apart

"Arya, just because we're burying her doesn't mean we've got to bury you too. We love you, so stop being a fucking idiot"

Stephanie's surfaced the best of me,
Through her sliplane ways and roadtax payed,
She played this game but chose to stay,
To wedge me out an automotive grave.

The zebra crossing must dissolve,
At contact with every driver's eyes,
Coz no one fucking stops or pauses,
When a pedestrian's wanting to cross it.

And Stephanie knows it all too well,
I'll egress this mortal plane through traffic,
Coz if I want to transcend this place,
I sure as hell could afford the tariff.

So she rang my phone from two cars down,
Told me to drop it, and to walk away,
That the old lady sitting (seething?) in her benz,
Isn't worth a verbal combat to the death.

She took me to the bus stop,
Then she took me to the train,
I missed the both of them once today,
But I think that I'm gonna be okay.
