Sorry I Skipped Your Sister's Funeral (Her Boyfriend Would Beat Me Up, Or I Him)
I Don't Know Your Names And I Was Graduating

You've lost your charm, you've got no more starlight in your eyes,
But that's all right, at least you've got some blood inside your heart.
Maybe you could try to find your eyes fixed somewhere onto mine,
Now till new year's on the dot, please don't rush, you've got some time.
