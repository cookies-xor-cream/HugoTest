Drop Hanging By The Inversion Of Airways; If It Cuts You Down, And If It Doesn't Then You'll Miss The Sundown Anyways

Play me a song and I'll string you along
To the fibrosis on thread that I have
In your lungs.

Don't sing me the words, in fear
Of your tongue, the wire is sharp,
I've got it fastened and hung.
