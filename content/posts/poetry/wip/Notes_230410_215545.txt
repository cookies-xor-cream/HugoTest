Betwixt Three Swans: You Can Barely See Cygnus

However Many Amps Can Stop My Heart

She took a drag and slurred her speech,
Raised her hand to try touch the sky she'd never reach,
"The stars are copies of copies of copies of,
A soul we found lit up in heaven up above".

She then signalled to her favourite dots,
And told me a story about a swan and his spawn,
Something about how she's the son of a war god,
And the cross she bore was a lightning rod.

We came out the river cold, baptized anew,
Must've washed away our words, since we had so few,
Shocked by the daughter of the lightning deity,
I lost my words in the sparking's severity.
