Immigration Via The Boatman: Living Is Heavy And Dying Is Light

"If you got to do it all again, what would you change?"

"Nothing"

"You've gotta change SOMETHING, don't you have regrets"

"Regretting something doesn't constitute erasure"

"Spotless mind, and whatnot, I suppose. So what would you change that you don't regret"

The ocean's like an anchor in my chest,
But I'm not ready to port this ship just quite yet,
Petition the harbour master to give away our spot,
Tell him charon needs a second of his time.

I'm not ready to crash-land at this time,
I may have control of the schedule,
But I'm helpless to the wall-time on the clock,
For it's in analogue, and I'm reading it all wrong.

I swear Elysium's an hour behind me,
And a rewind, heaven-sent, would set me free,
Don't tie me to the mast, I'll exit to the sea,
And time would close the distance onto me.
