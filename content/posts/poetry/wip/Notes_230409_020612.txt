Hazel's Door Was Infinitely Far Away After Drink 23: I Just Collapsed Where I Was

Nothing Happened

I'm gonna wake up in my home,
The pair of them assume I always find my way back,
But last month I rose in a stranger's living room.

I tried to make it out the door,
But I didn't have the reasons so I curled up and I
Found a spot next to the sofa on the floor.

Rebecca woke me up, or at least,
I think that that's her name,
The entire thing felt like a picture set,
Just slightly out of frame.
