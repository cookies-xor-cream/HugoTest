The Watched: The Paranoia Of Existence
Today Was Weird; I Missed The Sunset, At Least The Moon Is Fucking Gorgeous

I stared down each digit on the postit note she stuck to my palm,
"I'm not using this, I can only fall for a friend",
"Could've just said you're demi. We'll start as friends",
"We'll stay as friends",
"What are you doing this evening?",
"Go to the city, 4.30 to 5, I'll be there",
"Where?",
"No, that's not how this works, if I run into you, then I owe you a sunset and a conversation. Nothing more, nothing less",
"And if you don't?",
"You found me twice today, you'll see me around, I'd gamble. Say hi when you do?"

I got off the bench to breathe some air, senza her, "Why me?",
"Reading and crying is an adorable pairing",
"I'll see you when I see you",
"Don't think I've seen someone love that book so much, so I hope that I do".

I dont know who put me here,
But I know I'd like a word,
Before this portrait dries up,
And the last of its cast defers.

Coz life is too fucking picturesque,
It feels orchestrated, like everything
Has been painted into place,
And too much of the backdrop
Has been too carefully erased.
