Steph, As Substituted For Therapy

"Describe her"

"Violent. Brash. Cold and distant"

"I meant physically"

"Oh. I don't recall"

"I don't need to know the colour of her eyes or anything. I know there's things you don't forget. Like violence of posture. So tell me that"

"How is this not romanticide?"

"Because necroticide is a morphological oxymoron, now describe"

So I tore a page from your journal, I picked up a pen,
Not a blank one but one adorned with your personal hell,
And I thought for a moment, and was uneasy at touch,
But was eased by the thought I'd never love you as much.

The bark, I know, has the same face as her,
I can't picture it, but know it that it is the case.
With oversized glasses, and a tally of cuts,
And that waist-length black lustre in need of a cut.

It mimicks how she splays all her fingers,
And how her hands linger angled at arm,
With a book like a cat cub that's gripped by the neck,
And a coffee at midnight, not nursed but beaten to death

She has the violence of a feeling I long since forgot,
Some festering suggestion of a terminal rot,
A gangrene, infection, a wound from a war,
A knife traced from dosum, and then up to my arm.

"Sorry, dear Fanak,
My little desert-dwelling thing.
I have a correction to make,
And hope this suggestion can stick"

"I'm going to hate this, aren't I?"

"When I said I wouldn't love you so much,
I really should've written that I'll never love you at all"

"Why are you always so harsh"

"Why are your hands always so prone to wandering?"

"You broke metre and rhyme"
