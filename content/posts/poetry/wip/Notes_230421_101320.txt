A Lightning Bolt Has Been Working It's Way Through My Spine For Years

I swear at some point in my sleep
I had each vertebra removed
So my vagus could be copper-strung
A little fire, and a little crackle
Imbued in every rung.

Conduction for a pillar storm
Nerves doubled as a lightning rod,
Like a prayer made on my behalf,
To whichever thunder god.

And every time life sees me dimmer
My vigilance a little too close to 'off',
It plugs me in using tunnel
That's digging through my spine.

I swear sometimes when a bad one hits
That it's the end of the fucking line,
I can feel the resistance of the metal
Burning through my little borrowed time.

The scans all came out empty,
Or as empty as they'd hoped,
Been sitting on this for near two weeks,
But this time nothing seems as bleak.

I think that maybe recently,
It might've been all of the sitting,
Putting pressure on the fluid building,
That let the lighning slowly sink straight in.

But it reached the scar from the surgery,
I just wish the next step to come
Is that it exits me.
