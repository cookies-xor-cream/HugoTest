I volunteered to be catching rain,  
lost an umbrella in an empty exchange,  
but I love collecting weather stains,  
to manifest mobile and rusted weathervanes.

Three transactions in a short-lived week,  
my bleeding purple heart is so damn bleak,  
but I can't help myself trying to feel,  
coz these nerves are now made of oxide steels.

My jaded zero-knowledge proofs,  
are the nash equilibrium in a zero-sum,  
I'm so fucking happy that I have a roof,  
and that tomorrow I'll get to see the sun.

There are worse things than to be alone,  
there are worse things than to have a house  
but never find a fucking home.  
At least with Stephanie, I'm alone in company.

At least with Stephanie I'm vacant in company,  
to keep the lonely out the vacancy,  
but sometimes I feel like I shouldn't bother  
to part this endless and salty sea.

Sometimes I feel like life  
has got me drowning, got me smothered.  
What does it even mean  
to moniker yourself her 'lover'?

I'd rather see you capsized in a gutter,  
flayed wide-open with the water stagnant, still.
