Are you barometric? Because I swear to god you put pressure on my heart,  
You know it doesn't beat, it doesn't pulse,not  until it's pressed into a start,  
It's ticking like a timer under the crackle of this turbulence passed as weather,  
And it's going to empty of its charge, to be static-free where static should be found.
