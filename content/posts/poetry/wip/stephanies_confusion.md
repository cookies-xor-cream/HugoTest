"You know, I never knew, I never understood  
What the fuck it was, the deal with you,  
Diurnal in day, but nocturnal by night,  
An insomniac in two-fold, like sleep is a blight.

You know, I always knew, I always understood  
That you're kept together by resin and by glue,  
Loosely assembled, though mangled and crude,  
By the acquiescence of this trivial pursuit".
