Stellar Vision And Ice Bucket Challenges

Thaw me out with solar eyes,
With helios caught inside your gaze,
And doubled down as a disguise,
The cost of which will stay unpaid.

A dionysiac daemon as aphrodisiac
A pheromone bomb that ignites the path
Back to the Icarus sun of coal,
That lay stolen with still-sparking bones.

An eros spine on the manticore
Got me spellbound, daydreaming gore,
That I stole back from nights of old,
Got me missing the heat that we dodged in cold.

This PRNG of a scalding road,
Like an ice bucket poured down at my feet,
Is a retroactive stochastic average,
Of the temperatures at which we both freeze,
But was solely cast on top of me.
