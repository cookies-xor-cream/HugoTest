Stellar Vision And Ice Bucket Challenges

Thaw me out with solar eyes,  
with helios caught inside your gaze,  
and doubled down as a disguise,  
the cost of which will stay unpaid.

A dionysiac daemon as aphrodisiac  
a pheromone bomb that ignites the path  
back to the Icarus sun of coal,  
that lay stolen with still-sparking bones.

An eros spine on the manticore  
got me spellbound, daydreaming gore,  
that I stole back from nights of old,  
got me missing the heat that we dodged in cold.

This PRNG of a scalding road,  
like an ice bucket poured down at my feet,  
is a retroactive stochastic average,  
of the temperatures at which we both freeze,  
but was solely cast on top of me.
