The Only One Night Stands I'd Agree To Are With A Concussion And The Floor

The lockjaw's in my hands,  
Outlining a crescent moon,  
That only has a single leg  
On which to stand.

I never caught the  
Hints you dropped,  
I missed them all,  
No, the only thing  
That I can catch  
Is asphalt on my palms.

I never caught the  
Psalms you sung,  
And honestly I think  
That I would prefer  
To catch the pavement  
On my hands.

I'm holding onto  
Remnants of a skidmark,  
Like paint across my hand,  
And it's healing  
Out my clutch,  
But I've been praying  
It won't come to pass.

It's repairing way too fast,  
I don't want the cuts to leave,  
I'd rather that they scar,  
God, I was hoping that they'd last.
