The Only One Night Stands I'd Agree To Are With A Concussion And The Floor

The lockjaw's in my hands,  
outlining a crescent moon,  
that only has a single leg  
on which to stand.

I never caught the  
hints you dropped,  
I missed them all,  
no, the only thing  
that I can catch  
is asphalt on my palms.

I never caught the  
psalms you sung,  
and honestly I think  
that I would prefer  
to catch the pavement  
on my hands.

I'm holding onto  
remnants of a skidmark,  
like paint across my hand,  
and it's healing  
out my clutch,  
but I've been praying  
it won't come to pass.

It's repairing way too fast,  
I don't want the cuts to leave,  
I'd rather that they scar,  
god, I was hoping that they'd last.
