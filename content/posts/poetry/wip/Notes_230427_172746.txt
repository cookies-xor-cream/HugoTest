Lightning Is The Excess Of Moonlight Fighting Itself Down Through The Stratosphere

I'm late but I found scattered scarcely on a bench,
And found beauty cached inside a nimbus wrench,
The limbs of moonlight, dimly clenched,
Wrapped by clouds, in palid light they couldn't fetch.

Someone cut up the moon, again, in half,
I reached up splaying the fingers on my hands,
But for lack of reach, or for lack of wisdom,
I found myself apart, spanning a kingdom.
