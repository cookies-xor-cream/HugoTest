She asked me if I could use a drink,
I asked her if it was okay in front of her kid,
And checked the time.

I had time before the birthday for a drunk walk home and a shower so I told her okay.

She brought an unopened bottle and two clean glasses. She let me inspect them, and didn't seem offended at the gesture. I poured myself a drink and asked her not to lurk near it.

She asked me for a story, an outline of all my life she missed, so I started at the top. And when I finished she asked me how and why I wasn't tired.

I reminded her of the way we used to live, and she realised that this last year was anything but quick of eventful. Relatively, anyways.

She asked for another story, this time about what I recalled of her. So I started at the top, again. But this time when I finished, I went to meet her gaze, and I could tell something didn't sit right with her.

She asked me, "That's all you remember?"
I nodded, so she continued, "it's funny, it breaks my heart a little. I'm sitting here with my friend from forever ago. And he sees me as a relative stranger".

She picked up her toddler and put him on her lap, "I would say I hoped you knew what you were doing. But I've known you long enough to know you don't half-commit".
