Only So Ductile

You look like a house plant in a house fire,
Stationary biomass inside the feeding pyre,
But I hope you can flower before you fly,
Maybe then we won't fuck up the last goodbye?

I just can't live the way that you'd prefer,
I'm in a shallow slow-burning arson simmer.
Steph, I think this toggle might be binary,
I can't variably dimmer, I'm short some copper
Inside of me.

Kitten's Lost Her Marbles

Why Don't Spectators Get Noclip?
How The Fuck Am I Gonna Cast This Match, Fennie?

Let's put the cat back in the bag,
Keep it short and sweet,
Not drawn and dragged.
I've got just a week
To waste with you,
And the only way
Around is through.

I know you promised,
I guess that was dumb,
But it's not your fault,
No, I'm the block.
We've just four days
Left on the clock.

You lie to her.
I'll pray for you.
The only way
Around is through.
