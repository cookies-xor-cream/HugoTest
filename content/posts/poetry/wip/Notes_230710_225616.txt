The Only Way Around Is Through

Let's put the cat back in the bag,  
Keep it short and sweet,  
Not drawn and dragged.  
I've got just a week  
To waste with you,  
And the only way  
Around is through.

I know you promised,  
I guess that was dumb.  
But it's not your fault,  
No, I'm the block.  
We've just four days  
Left on the clock.

You lie to her.  
I'll pray for you.  
The only way  
Around is through.
