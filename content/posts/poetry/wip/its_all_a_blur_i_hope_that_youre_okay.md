I know tomorrow I'll do the laundry, get the blood stains off my shirt. And kid, come the day I know their absence will have me feeling some kind of way. 

I would trade any other day for another impromptu visit turned hospital stay to comfort my stupid friend by playing with her hair.

I guess the pills didn't work, she's always acting like a bottle holding in a storm. But I know if she left me on this tiny rock alone, I would wither away at home.

It's funny, isn't it, how the two of us only find our stability when we're trapped in shitty relationships? But ironically I'm not that for you. And you aren't that for me.

You're you, however marked, however branded or riddled in scars. However extinguished that dim glimmer of dying stars behind your eyes.

You're who you are, it's not too much.  
It's always exactly enough.  
Through your rushed slurred speech and half-jittery stutters or sleights of wrist.  
Whatever flaw you have, don't call it that.  
It's perfect just the way it is.

"Are you immediate family" my fucking ass. Blood is thicker than water, and my shirt is lathered in that substance.

P.S. Steph sorry I couldn't stomach the image so P had to call the ambulance.
