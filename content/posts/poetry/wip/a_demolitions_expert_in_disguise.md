Playing an angel on my shoulder, she's a devil featherclad,  
Can't get it out of my head that Stephanie said she's the best she ever had.

Fuck, I'd take just about anything fucking else than her fucking with my head in a slow correspondence of weekly texts.

Her place felt like home, I had a nephew, kindred more poigniant than blood,  
But she sullied her hand, tried to mulligan enough but the whole deck's way too much.

So we cracked open a bottle, whiskey on the boardwalk, found a bench in the park,  
Then she went quiet, tried to kiss me, asked for the freshest of new starts.

She forfeit my place with her son sat in her study at her desk,  
When you refuse to take the answer you're given there's no makeups for the test.  
Just parallel smudges of makeup, tears running mascara down your face.

Sic sempre, sempre ad infinitum, orthogonal to a long-lost and surgically fixtured grace.
