I thought I finally found a quiet Tuesday. You had to autoapparate huh. I swear to god it just takes some aqueous weather for you to undergo a precipitation reaction with the air.

I found you following me  
With an umbrella in hand,  
You said that you'd rather  
Track rain than try stand.

You offered me your shelter,  
And we debated it through,  
So I found myself walking  
Shoulder to shoulder with you.

You beckoned me for a ride,  
I said that I would rather die,  
Than walk you until your car,  
Much less fucking get inside.

I always pondered the thought,  
Of what if the devil were a chemist,  
But I suppose there's proof that he is,  
In the fact that you  
SO  
FUCKING  
STUBBORNLY  
PERSIST?
