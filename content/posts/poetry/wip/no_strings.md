People fall so fast,  
But love so slow,  
Like a product of  
A circumstance,  
That's always nurtured,  
But never grows.

She said the  
Boy across the hall,  
Has respect,  
And never bites,  
And she hasn't  
Time to stall.

At the closing  
Of the month  
She's got a date  
With a psychopomp,  
Some Abrahamic truth,  
And it's canine tooth.

Honey, hear you me,  
If I could do  
Then I would do.  
But I'm just not  
A walking distance  
Away from you.
