An Open Letter From My Sleep; He Said He'd Steal My Body Next Time I Blinked

"Hello to the waking version of me,
I'm asleep, but more lucid than you
Will ever fucking manage be.

What I lack in handwriting,
I make up for in analysis of
The supposed subtlety.

Did you misplace your brain,
Or is this some masochistic ploy,
Coz 'stupid' beats 'in pain'
And 'flunking's beaten by 'foiled'.

I wish that I could possess you,
To swap around the order for
The conscious and the recess thoughts.

Next time that you sleepwalk,
You better hide the zopiclone,
Coz I'll put action to my talk,
Make your waking walking stuper,
Into a nightmare stalking a future
That won't come".
