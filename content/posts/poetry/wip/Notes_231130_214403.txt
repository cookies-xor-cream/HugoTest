Shame I'm Not A Perfectionist, Because This Would've Been Perfect

I'm afraid of brand new, I prefer my love to come a little used,  
Cut the bleeding with a tourniquet, but don't cut out the abuse.  
Abrasion is preferred, if not for heat then friction's of no use,  
Just don't make it so rough that you'd burn in this conversation.

She wants loveless expression, I hate that arrangement,  
I want expressionless love without the estrangement,  
And when as above so below, if you crack the sky, where would we go?  
Why'd you only want to reap, when I only want to sow?

Anyway, nevertheless, I'm gonna get back to this staring contest,  
I'm playing against a screen even though I'm right besides her,  
She has to go for a 'mental health first aid' course in fifteen  
Where everything they'll show her she'd have already felt and seen.
