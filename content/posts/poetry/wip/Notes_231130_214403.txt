Shame I'm Not A Perfectionist, Because This Would've Been Perfect

I'm afraid of brand new, I prefer my love a little used,
Cut the bleeding with a tourniqeut, but don't cut out the abuse.
A little abrasion goes a long way, like a propulsion by friction,
Just don't make it so rough that you put a crack in this conversation.

She wants loveless expression, I hate that arrangement,
I want expressionless love minus the estrangement,
As above so below, if you crack the sky, where would we go?
Why are we so half cooked? Why'd you only want to reap, when I only want to sow.

Anyhow, I'm gonna get back to this staring contest,
Played against a screen, even though I'm right besides her,
She has to go for a 'mental health first aid' course in fifteen
Where everything they'll show her she's already felt and seen.
