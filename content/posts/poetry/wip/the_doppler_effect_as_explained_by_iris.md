I feel like I'm beating this subject matter down,  
as if it's open season, like its pride month for a  
rainbow-painted dead horse, masquerading as the  
husk of a lost scarab, playing the cash cow's ghost.

I need the rainbow goddess to come and try descend,  
to rescind all of the sins that she forgot previously chose to send,  
and bend all of the rules that she never could revert.  
overtly a marker, painting me covertly as a fleeting fading target.

What the fuck is there more to say on this?  
I met someone with an obsessive tendency,  
and now I feel a little bit less at ease,  
the last paces to my driveway, they siphon off my peace.
