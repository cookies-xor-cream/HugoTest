If I Could Author A Life, I'd Rewrite My Own, Featuring A Mortal Reminder (But I Bet The Fates Would Miss Their Plaything And There'd Be Some Cthonic Backlash)

I've got a few pointers for Eurydice
On how to fall out of this feeling,
But I won't hurt myself explaining,
I know she's not listening anyway.

Bury me before you bet me on a coin-toss,
A 50/50 fallen into a river we can't cross.
Simultaneously too much and never enough.
That's how we write it this time anyway.

Fuck Orpheus.
Fuck, Orpheus.

Euphemia, if you're here, I know that you're yelling.
Stop, please stop wasting your breath
(Although it's not like you've got use for it anyway).
