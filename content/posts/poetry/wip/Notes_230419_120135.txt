My Gaze Births Fulcrums Of My Dreamscape, And It's Aversion Exempts Things From The Dream

The knife loosely spun in his hand, he spoke to nobody in particular, as if to name it. The words, I didn't quite catch, but I heard something of bringing the sunrise or the dawn?

The name felt less like a bestowing, and more like the implication of a request for permission. Unsure of the details I withdrew every attempt at response.

Impatiently gripping steel, he tugged my arm so it lay straight, facing up: "Do you trust me, that this isn't one of those dreams that echoes your wakefullness?"

Noticing hesitation he repostulated, "do you trust I can do this in isolation?"

I nodded, not in agreement, but in morbid curiosity instead; hoping intention and outcome were independent.

And so he tightened his grip on both me and the half-dull prompt for morning light, "It'll barely sting", and unzipped my arm, removing its jacket. My arm, a layer short, distributed its heat in the form of excessive bloodloss.

Seemingly finished, he got himself up, unable to sit still but equally allergic to keeping his posture upright (without sharing in the balance of my shoulder). He dug up the last in him left of anything to quietly slur out a parting question.

"Isn't it so pretty?",
I'd already caught my eyes on a star I'd never seen before, but felt incline to agree with him all the less.

With however much validity my blurry eyes could corroborate the sky's beauty with anyways.
