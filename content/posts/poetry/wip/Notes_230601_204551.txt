Coping Mechanisms, Volume IX: "I'm Happy She Tried, Just Wish Circumstances Differed"

If you had only asked,  
Then I think I'd have answered yes.  
Even though I might not want to,  
I need to prove that that's the case.

Coz I can't seem to feel a thing,  
In the absence of a kiss,  
I need to run the tests  
To see the lust replaced.

And I'm tired of the talks,  
Of all the explanations how  
My heart is under lock and key,  
And my lips are sealed for now.

And if you ever see them rift,  
Leave them floating easy,  
Victim to the rivers drift,  
Just let the seagulls sift.

Leave the buzzards to my corpse,  
In my cadavral still repose,  
And if we find the chemistry,  
I'll see my lack of love deposed

I'll see you in another life,  
But I need to let 'us' die,  
I need to exorcise this demon.  
I'm just looking to survive.
