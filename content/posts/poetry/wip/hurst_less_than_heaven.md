I confessed to her I didn't really remember much,  
with a photo in hand she caught me in the vortex of her clutch,  
it was like a movie playing where my eyes should've been,  
but the motion pictures played without the soundtrack of the screams.

I fell out my body, then snapped back in time,  
left with nothing more than contact-exposure for the remnant of the cinders of her crime,  
I wasn't sure if forgiveness was in stock,  
but I don't hold a grudge, I couldn't give a fuck.

I heard of how her husband went,  
and how the money vanished, showed up spent,  
her tightened grip dug into my fabric,  
she wanted an answer I'd find too tragic.

She asked me if quitting was that damn hard,  
I told her all it needs is a hell of a jumpstart,  
you just pick up the gun, qnd loosen your aim,  
then you start taking shots in the dark, till you bullseye the pain.

I told her it's the best choice that I ever made,  
that the demon dies when it can't satiate,  
she asked me how, what sparked the change?  
I told her that the ball lightning was a friend leaving me alone in this cage.

"She didn't leave you",  
"Are you on team 'Murder By Omission'?",  
"I'm on team 'Sorry, It's My Fault' I suppose".

She stared at me, while I stared through her,  
my head's somewhere between nowhere here and not yet there,  
not sure what this random middle aged lady's on about,  
all I know is that I couldn't care and was going to show myself out.
