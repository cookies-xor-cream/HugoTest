Lithium (Nonelemental)

Bipolar, but that's not what makes you sick,
So along the way you must've fallen ill,
And I'm petrified, sitting statue-still,
Like I'm a bathroom-tethered mannequin,
Hung upon drapery and loosely kept by pins,
I claw at the curtains, "please just let me in",
But you add a 'no' to 'vacancy',
So we held hands through the
Shower curtain screen.

I guess we'll talk about this here,
With this parchment in between,
Your words have never been more clear,
Muffled by the shower curtain screen.
