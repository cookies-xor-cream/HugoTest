She found a wrinkle in time, and made it a crease,  
I'll let go of my grip, and with the pressure released,  
you can see the black paint streak on her arms,  
like the markings of a voluntary, external self-harm.

She insisted that she must share in my pain,  
but I insisted that that need makes her insane,  
if you want to feel what I do in this state,  
then cut off your tongue, and wire your jaw,  
then bask in the taste.
