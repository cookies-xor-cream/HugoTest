My hand's been mauled into a trinket,  
it's leaking rubies, I wanna wring it,  
I suppose she beat me to the thing,  
when she forgot it and then she squeezed.  
I lost a couple millitres of jewelry,  
but in the form of this rusty crimson ink,  
though I'm not fussed, I had no plans to lose it,  
I sure as hell am never gonna drink or try use it.
