Seeing Paris Again

It was a good night, a little rainy if I recall correctly. But then again, the weather isn't ever properly committed to my memory.

It was the break from marking papers that I needed, a night that ebbed and flowed with company that flooded and promptly after fleeted.

Honestly, there were only two parts of it that I remembered. The first being your skin's affinity to forming bruises under pressure.

The other being you making coffee that we drank out on your porch, and your conspicuous repetitious mention that you lived here all alone.

I thought I made a friend on a three hour long midnight walk: a night well-spent. But you had to fucking kiss me, to make it another date.

Great. Just fucking great. Another girl who always wonders what will come of this if her wrists begin to meander and to wander.
