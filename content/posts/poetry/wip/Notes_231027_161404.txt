God can't author an original fucking story. This is just a tragic rendition of Melania and whatshername. Reminds me of Prismo in Fiona And Cake.

I saw you before your out-bound flight,
You were acting crazy in the car,
Sitting in but not truly confined
To your post made on the passenger side.

You asked way too many questions
To which you couldn't take replies.
I suppose that you never knew
Your sister was pregnant when she died.

It wasn't my place to tell you anything,
That girl would kill me if she still had hands,
But I suppose when one's dead and buried,
Homicide is just barely out of grasp.

I told you to just let the past be buried,
But you keep wondering if she ever told the dad.

(The answer is no. And why the fuck would she, he probably thinks she's ghosting him. But the 'ghost' part is accurate only in all thr wrong ways).
