Forgiving Is Forgetting With A Lower Heartrate

Amber and Hazel feel too similar?
They show up at all the wrong times, and tend to not make themselves known.

Maybe it's late and my head is drawing red thread between pins that are a reality diverged.

I always think of Amber for a day or two after every haircut. And it's always the bad fucking parts.

Leave you me, I'll be counting the threads,
Part of me's happy you're moving soon(?!),
Part of me's hoping I get a target for some lead.

I left my response at home, but I won't need it,
If they're waiting, then they're in a lack of my trust,
And that's what let the last one get close enough.
