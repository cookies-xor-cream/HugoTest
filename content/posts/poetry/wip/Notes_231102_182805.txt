A Brief Recount Of The Last Few Weeks Of "Let's See Where This Goes" (I Scrolled Past Your Contact Briefly, I Suppose I'm Lucky That Boy Is Blind, He Didn't Seem To Pick Up On Your Name)

Have you heard?
Clancy of the overflow
Died hazy in the undertow.
I promise you if rain could kill
What lies remnant of you still,
It would pitter-patter you away
Into the brink of your mortality,
Edge you on the final Inch of life.

It would wipe the vestiges away,
Leaving nothing but a murder mystery
That a storm cloud wrote for me.
