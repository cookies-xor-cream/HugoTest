Cthonians Clad In Corinthian Cowhide

Transatlantic angel,
You've got confessions you must make,
Before the noon rescinds to make the space
For your midnight wake.

Cispacific starlight,
You've got sins you should correct,
Before the solar sheen can bloom
As fire upon your hair.

Helios disciple,
You razed an ocean with no care,
Life may be a damned brutalist,
But people can be fair.

Highland stranded siren,
I'd hate to see your stars allide,
But the sky is close to falling,
Let's just hope that it's eliding.

Coastline seeking wyvern,
You tore your wings to shreds,
But remember that this is fate
Still preferable to death.
