Angel Turned Comet

She left because I made a phone call  
but turns out I'm staying a while.

I kinda wanna run after her.  
but I know how fucking stupid that would be.

We debated the taxonomy,  
of paper cuts and bite marks,  
laying stark upon your collar,  
slowly bleeding out their colour.

I broke my halo long ago,  
and at long last you lost yours too,  
premeditation's gotta be a  
hell of a stance, sweetie,  
your status as Oberon has come to pass.

And when the clock decides to tick,  
that's Chronos counting you away,  
we both knew that I could never stay,  
that there isn't a payment for the penance,  
that's sufficient for the sins  
that we have found inside ourselves.
