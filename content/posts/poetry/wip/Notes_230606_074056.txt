Angel Turned Comet

She left because I made a phone call
But turns out I'm staying a while.

I kinda wanna run after her.
But I know how fucking stupid that would be.

We debated the taxonomy,
Of paper cuts and bite marks,
Laying stark upon your collar,
Slowly bleeding out their colour.

I broke my halo long ago,
And at long last you lost yours too,
Premeditation's gotta be a
Hell of a stance, sweetie,
Your status as Oberon has come to pass.

And when the clock decides to tick,
That's Chronos counting you away,
We both knew that I could never stay,
That there isn't a payment for the penance,
That's sufficient for the sins
That we have found inside ourselves.
