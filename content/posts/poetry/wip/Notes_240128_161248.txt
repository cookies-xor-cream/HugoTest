Character Assassination At An Audition For This Rom-com Of A Year

I'm a stranger stuck inside this skin,
I'm watching this dull life it lives,
Like I'm viewing a shitty film,
And half-remember everything.

I'm on the stage but off the script,
I'm trembling though my anxious ticks,
She's shaking through her nervous fits,
Guess it's just an acting thing.

She reaches out to raise my chin,
My head is light, it starts to spin,
She's hungry now to taste the kill,
But I have eaten, had my fill.

Dark strikes the room, it's void of light,
And empty like her glassy eyes,
She asks if I would stay a while,
Let's cut for break, we're overtime.

I'm sorry for my rude decline,
But I trust that she'll hold up fine,
I cut the take and find my lines,
"This shot's done, thanks for your time".
