You commanded me come to the op suite at will,  
substituted methane with chlorides so that I would stay still,  
with your scalpel in hand, and malpractice-insured,  
you poked at the parts that you wanted removed.

I awoke more feline than canine, was unkindred at home,  
so I slipped out my shackles, and was free then to roam,  
you had known it as lying, I think I'm forced to agree,  
coz half-truths are the subject of your doctor's degree.

I wish that you believed me, thought I knew what I did,  
that this blatant mistrust was something we could've rid,  
but soliloquy found itself with a filter in play,  
and excised the feelings from what you wanted to say.

My coronary puzzle's  
not a heart and its riddle,  
it's just a plea for a peace, and  
you don't want to have fiddled.

You thought that I must've loved you,  
but you showed me that it was in vain,  
you reareanged my atria,  
but they're still beating the same.
