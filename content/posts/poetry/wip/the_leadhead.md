I miss you, god, how long's it been?  
Is our life unravelling at the seams?  
Can we got a coffee: you, your cat, and me?  
I'm free right now, on this dreamless night.  
What the fuck is wrong with me, it's 4am,  
I guess that I have lost my mind for I'm happy you replied,  
But I should really sleep before the break of light.

We're lost between your bipolar and my manic tendencies,  
I'm lost inside the deprivation of my weekly ten hours sleep,  
I'm found inside your bedhead on this blue and sunny day,  
Your hair's looming on your smile, like a storm cloud on your head,  
A pileous pouring like a tempest, raining plumbum onto lead,  
But your skull's so dense, the water will never find your brain,  
But that's okay, I'm plenty sure it needs some lithium instead.
