You look like a house plant in a house fire,  
stationary biomass inside the feeding pyre,  
but I hope you can flower before you fly,  
maybe then we won't fuck up the last goodbye?

I just can't live the way that you'd prefer,  
I'm in a shallow slow-burning arson simmer.  
Steph, I think this toggle might be binary,  
I can't variably dimmer,  
I'm short some cuprum Inside of me.
