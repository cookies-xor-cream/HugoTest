Someone left roses at my house,  
A gift to which I came home: my father's guest's  
Curiosity asking me about.

I'd give an explanation but I'm just as confused,  
Don't know if Max, Hazel, or Parisa,  
We're equidistant from the truth.

She used to leave roses on your driveway,  
Though I told her you were allergic,  
But there was nothing I could say  
To turn her frenzied hands away,  
From that improvisation of a grave.

She saved you in alabaster,  
Chiselled veins throughout your wrists,  
She thought that it'd last her,  
But to me it's just a reminder,  
Of the needles that you hid.
