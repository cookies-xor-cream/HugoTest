All that time I called you wormfood,  
will finally come true in a month or two.  
you said something I had said was prompt,  
to set his heart aflame, and see the embers stomped.

And that makes it the second time today,  
that I'm the cause for breakup and for ache,  
coz I ran into Carla chaining cigarettes,  
like it was a drama she'd desperately rehearsed.

She told me I should shut my mouth,  
that she overdosed on truth, and needed lies,  
so I told her "it's okay, if you've got the time,  
then I'll stay with you, and talk a while".

She asked if we were friends,  
I asked her for her contact,  
but she said the time had passed,  
she'd like to keep chance encounters,  
cast in resin and intact.  
exactly as they were:  
nothing more than chance.

But I can see that that's a lie,  
that you've rehearsed and rerehearsed  
this verbal dance one too many times.
