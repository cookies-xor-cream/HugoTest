Drunk On Catching Colds

I think I contracted
A fever from your lips,
You transmitted a disease,
Latent, but distilled.

Today I woke up, was
Getting slowly sick,
Guess that's my karma
For such a selfish kiss.

You quoted me lyrics,
Said that I had only
Done it for the thrill,
Becausw my heart was still.

And you think all that
Proximity to your face
Killed the part that beats,
Now it needs to be replaced.

I don't think that I agree,
Just let me make my case:
Despite the lack of drink,
I wasn't in that sober of a place.
