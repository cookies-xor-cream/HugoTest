Angeldust, Amberdust

I followed the glitter from a seraph,
Like it was the labyrinth's golden thread,
We made it through the bursting colours,
And looked back as they decayed.
The trees all turned to angel oaks,
The burning sawdust only left us smoke.

I lost a surrogate by the riverside,
Tripped and kissed the foreshore in stopmotion,
She kicked me over onto my back, and reached to me to pull me by my hand,
But I grabbed her arms and anchored her body down to lay besides me.

We marked an X along the riverbank,
Where the excess from the high tide would try its best to hide
And cover the slate stone pillows on which we sat,
Where we were slowly sinking as we drank away
The final few hours of this ride,
The colours on her face rearranged,
As if to spell that I need to say 'goodbye'.
