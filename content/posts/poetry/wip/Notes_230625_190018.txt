Hi soon-to-be angel,

I need this letter reach Minor Minor.
Angel told me you were speaking to him.

I suppose that makes one of us, so tell him this for me:
I hate that you were stunted,
The world lost something
Inside countless concussions.

I saw her gravestone.
I don't understand how your memory is so brief, and yet your focus so deep.

I wonder sometimes, do you think of me how I think of you?

Of course not. If anything at all, you'd only have lapses of memory, and none any pleasant.

I thought I'd write this how you'd write it, I think a letter like this, I would write simply.

But for you: simply to be is to be simply not.

And so instead of scribing existence, I thought I'd leave you with a dream of the void.

I know you like titles that are way too fucking long so here is one:

I Wonder If He Thinks Of Me Like I Think Of Him, But Really I Hope He Doesn't Think At All. He Deserves Some Silence Not Punctuated By Love. I Was At The Tejo When I Heard, I Wish I Could Share The River, Perhaps I Can Share The News. Bitter-sweet, Happy And Unhappy. It Is All The Irony A Mind Like Yours Imagines

Hey there,
Minor Minor,
I thought I'd leave
You a fragment
Of disaster.

To let
You live
Vicarious,
As bystander,
Or play
Pretend as
Enacter.

My sister,
My mother.
They died.
Car crash.
At happy,
Happy last.

The present
Is in
The past.
