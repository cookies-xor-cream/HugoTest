Relaying A Letter

Hey there, Minor Minor,
I thought I'd leave you
This final fragment
Of disaster.

To let you live vicarious,
As a perpetual bystander,
Or play pretend as,
The arbitration's enactor.

My sister and my mother.
They died. A car crash.
At happy, happy last,
Their burden came to pass.

The present's no longer stuck
Alive only inside the past.
