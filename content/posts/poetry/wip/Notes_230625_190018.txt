Relaying A Letter

Hey there, Minor Minor,  
I thought I'd leave you  
this final fragment  
of disaster.

To let you live vicarious,  
as a perpetual bystander,  
or play pretend as,  
the arbitration's enactor.

My sister and my mother.  
they died. A car crash.  
at happy, happy last,  
their burden came to pass.

The present's no longer stuck  
alive it is only in the past.
