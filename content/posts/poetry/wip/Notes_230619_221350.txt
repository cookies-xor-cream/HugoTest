She Don't Care If She Die Tomorrow Coz She Was Meant To Die Yesterday

You lit up your last cigarette,
I asked about your health,
You said talk about that topic,
Was already overspent.

I asked about your scars,
You asked about my scans,
I asked about your wrists,
And you asked about my hands.

You were meant to die,
And a life ago no less,
But you were here at 20,
Destroying me at chess.

I love your hallowed words,
And I love the way you think,
I miss too much of you
Every time I blink.

I saw you at my window,
Then met you by the swings,
We pretended we were teenagers,
You needed one last win.
