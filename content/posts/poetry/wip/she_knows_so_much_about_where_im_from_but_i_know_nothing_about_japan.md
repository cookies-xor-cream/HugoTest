Guess I'm oil, and she's water.  
Fuck me, I would beg.  
I would pray, and plead,  
Trade, exchange, and barter.

We talked about mixing oil and water,  
The war on renaming the gulf besides  
The Arabian sea.

We talked about wasps and fig trees,  
And how fox sightings were common  
In that scene.

We talked about limes and ruby fruit,  
How the acetic taste overpowers  
Aqueous truth.

We talked about what she thought we were,  
And I didn't dare say "something lovely",  
I wasn't that brave.

We talked about her fingers and her ring,  
How I wanted to pawn off and resalvage  
That aurous thing.

We talked about words and how they're born,  
We talked about how she's angry but  
She feels torn.

We talked about brakes and oxidation,  
How we were chasing up a catalyst but  
Lacking the reagent.

I asked her ironically, "who's the other guy",  
I was planning to tell her about the Amber light,  
But we never got that far.
