'Hazel', 'The Swiss', 'Whatshername',  
Fuck attachment, I'm scared of names,  
'Wormfood', 'Gemstone', 'Gemstone 2',  
But namelessness never felt good with you.  
It's a decade you have known my name,  
So fuck it, let's see where this friendship ends.

If I know your name, and you know mine,  
Maybe we'll stay tethered till the end of time.

Fuck, I need to stop doing this.  
Give me something else to focus on.  
Some way else to live.
