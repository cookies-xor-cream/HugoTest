Phobical Priorities

You started laughing in the absence of a prompt,  
I asked what stupid thing was on your mind this time,  
You said all your friends were getting married recently,  
But mine were all getting divorced or buried.

You told me you were never afraid that you would die,  
But dread the day you'll meet the wrong boy and go say hi.
