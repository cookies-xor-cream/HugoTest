How is it, if you are real,  
my hand passes through you?  
How is it, if you are here,  
my words fall short of you?

How is it that in a single metre,  
there's more distance than  
the sum of each and every measure.

Tell me,  
Treasure.

Tell me,  
Dear.

Is there anything,  
more separating,  
than a mutually felt fear?
