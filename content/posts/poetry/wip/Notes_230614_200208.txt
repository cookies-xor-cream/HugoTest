How is it, if you are real,
My hand passes through you?
How is it, if you are here,
My words fall short of you?

How is it that in a single metre,
There's more distance than
The sum of each and every
Measure.

Tell me,
Treasure.

Tell me,
Dear.

Is there anything,
more separating,
than a mutually felt
fear?
