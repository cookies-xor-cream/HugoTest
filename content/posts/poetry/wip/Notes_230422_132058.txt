I Eventually Wound Up On Both Ends Of Her Headboard

My friend hit me with the classic "meet my girlfriend", and immediate exit before I could explain I'd already known her so much longer.

She said I grew up, and got taller. I wasn't sure what else to say. She looked mostly the same, give or take some ink that I was too afraid to ask about at the time.

The silence was awkward at first, interrupted here and there by an observation that was made for the sake of breaking silence.

I couldn't really see her through the combination of the low lighting and the waterfall running down my face. And so I took comfort in the assumption that we shared this myopia.

We heard the shower start and in the realisation that we were stranded I attempted to reconnect, "The notches at the headboard?"

She pointed at one side, "the lives I've saved", then she swung her hand around, "the lives I ruined".

I asked her if she remembered to count me on the happier side, and she quietly nodded: "I hope at the very least it meets in the middle".

I knew I shouldn't have, but I couldn't withhold myself from counting through the few people I knew, or knew of.

I hoped my headboard would have fewer notches, not knowing that if I counted I would have carved out my entire bed by now.
