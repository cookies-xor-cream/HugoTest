An Epilogue For The Next One, I Guess

"Hey Amber could we please pretend,
That I reciprocated this,
Could you just fucking let me believe,
I held up my end of the deal?

I have this toggle in my chest,
But I can't fucking reach that far,
Either it's been long suppressed,
Or we're one too many stars apart".
