Im A Poorly Maintained Makeshift Divider Between A Pair Of Rooms That Should've Stayed United

You dont euthanize a dog by chaining it to a running radiator and shooting it in the foot.

Aim steady, or not at all,
Kill heavy, or just light enough,
That they scarcely survive.

Clad in her rain-tattered shirt
Wore under my paint-splattered jacket
That stole the freshly coated gray
From up again the wall that she had pushed me to before
In anger.

I'd distinctly heard the timbre
And the pulse,
Of my spine slating up that wall,
Coz we solved the Basel function,
With this outburst of our dysfunction.

But her knife against my throat,
Wasn't half as scary as the
Letters that she wrote.
But still, she pushed it hard enough to scrape
The blood off my skin like it was paint,
And it would run right off but never take,
"Please chip at the drywall for my sake".

And as the wound wept, she loosened her grip,
In the fear that my jugular was only shy a single slip.

So I think that if you ask for a list,
Of every regret that she has ever lived,
It's that she found inverse goldilocks inside the cut,
That it should either've been more shallow,
Or that it wasn't deep enough.
