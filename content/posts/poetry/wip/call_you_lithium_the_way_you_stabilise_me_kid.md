Hi, I think I need you. These brief stints of "can't stay still" are too much without my friend. It feels like they never fucking end. Like insomnia played in blur where I don't need to sleep in any way, at least until the bursts of manic wear and tear, leaving empty space for the half-filled vacancies cluttering the schedule for my day.

I'm frayed at the seams, scratched up into static like an old pirated CD. Like white noise rainbow splashes on shitty bootleg of a 30fps set of tiny moving stills.
