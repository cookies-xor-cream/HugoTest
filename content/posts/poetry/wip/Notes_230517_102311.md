She Gave Me A Key To Her Place; I Gave Her A Knife And A Hairpin

She's a skeleton key that's
Made of broken bone and
Vacant chest cavities.

The lock's too rusted
To be opened, trapped
Shut, and out of place.

You'll never talk it open
From that side, can't break
It if not from inside.

What is it we were, and
What were you meaning
For this disaster to be?

The mirror stayed shattered
Against the claccard
Of a reflection I can't see.

I can't see.
Instead I can hope,
But believing is a
Slippery fucking slope.

I can't breathe,
Till your thought's estranged,
Riddled like a target
On a fictitious shooting range.

Unlock me,
Unhand me,
Lose your grip
And strand me.

I have vacancy
In my heart,
In part reserved for you,
But that doesn't excuse
Half the shit you want to do.
I just wanted 'me and you',
Never wanted 'us', so sorry
For the hints I dropped.
