"Why are you so silent?",
"I can talk to you all year",
"And so you shouldn't now?",
"I get your company once a year. I didn't want to distract 

Long distance is so fucking hard,
In the absence of the convenience,
Of company in person, it's a different
Thing than sitting on a call, still in silence.

Words are the rift, our discourse is cursed,
You're stumbling on the slang,
We could never rehearse.

Let it go, context is enough,
As much as I love speech,
I'd sooner be rid of it,
If I could listen twice as much.

All I have now left, is the
Annual fieldside monologue,
Followed by sitting in the quiet,
In the void of dialogue.

Mono, di, tri, and tetra,
You'll be 'ciel', and I'll be 'petra',
Coz only wind erodes the duplicity,
But if you offered, and I confirmed,
Would you let us?
