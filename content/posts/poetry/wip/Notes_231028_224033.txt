Mad Honey

The ebb and flow of pain will come and go,
Never fully blowing out or burning low.

It'll wax and wane, forever changing, yet
Still the very same in form and name.

It sticks to me, like flies to sweets,
Like my life is made of honeyed things.

As such, it's such a fucking tragedy
That honey ferments to mead,
And when we are born as yeast,
Life cannot stay forever sweet.
