I met the demon of my sleep,
Residing deep inside my dreams,
In a seldom single hour allowance,
A hypnotic revenant in a reverie.

The voice between my ears,
Is him and it is no one else's,
This rambling in my head
Comprises of his sleepless verses.

When I'm running low enough,
But perfectly highly functional,
An hour breaks my memory,
I can't remember anything at all.

I'm not 'running' on an hour's sleep,
I wouldn't even call this 'walking',
But ask my heart, for he is stuck
On a calmer 'fully fucking sprinting'.

I suppose the demon fell asleep,
For I lost the narrator in my head,
He got tired when I did not,
So he has fucked off to his bed.

Let the record document,
Haphazard villainous intent,
Let the ledger clearly show:
That the last of me is fully spent.
