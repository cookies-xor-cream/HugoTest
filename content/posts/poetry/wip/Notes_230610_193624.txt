What Do I Do With Hypothetical Evidence Of A Theoretical Crime?

She replied to my "Hello?"  
with "hello yourself,  
YOU called ME tonight",  
but I'm happy and in  
no mood to start a fight.

She asked for a walkthrough,  
an account of tonight,  
so I walked her through,  
but she chose to pick a fight.

Now she's no stranger to  
saying what she thinks,  
but I swear to fucking god,  
she's got me on the brink.

With this self-loathing,  
blame-eating bullshit,  
told me that the  
pattern starts with me.

And maybe I was more correct,  
when I would jest in fucking irony.

She's more sardonic than I am.  
and more sarcastic than I could be.  
said if I took the girlfriend out the equation,  
she would've done the same to me.
