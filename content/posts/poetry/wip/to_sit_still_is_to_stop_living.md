Eight hours a day for thrice each week,  
I'm plagued by the curse of sitting still,  
but I'm only perfectly fallen into place when  
I'm not stuck married to a single space.

I need to walk, but I'm not able to explain,  
why missing me this option's so much pain,  
my sisyphean pedestrianism's analgesia's  
a walking NMDA agonism's antianaesthesia.
