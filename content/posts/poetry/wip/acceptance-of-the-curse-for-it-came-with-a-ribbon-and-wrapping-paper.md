The distance to her face,  
Made like an accordion  
Tumbling down the stairs,  
Was both too close and  
Yet far enough away.

Simultaneously wild and tame.  
So I went to ask a favour  
"Unhand me please, dear stranger",  
Tried for a warning: "contagion  
Will catch you diseased,"  
But I found I couldn't even speak.

For my tongue from me estranged,  
Whether down through my throat,  
Or removed from my body:  
I didn't really know.

I felt the disconnect between  
Us two so strongly,  
As we played couriers for ideas,  
Delivered only by a proxy.

And in the absence of my speaking,  
You took a chance you shouldn't have,  
And though I'm too calm to be shaking,  
My stillness was waxing and was waning.

You were starting to be scaring me,  
With the way you sharpened every word,  
And the way your thoughts unravelled  
Was somewhere amidst deranged and absurd.

I called you Amber by mistake,  
The syllables slithered like a snake,  
Through your ear and then your brain,  
Exiting at the other end.

You're sweet but bad for the soul,  
I thought being a single mother,  
Would make that protein unfold,  
But you're just a prion in search of others.

*"I'll give you the self as offering,*  
*To get her out your head,*  
*To remove her from this state,*  
*Else she'll stay until you're dead".*

I liked that thought, your  
Words were sweet,  
But far too organised,  
And came out far too neat.

This wasn't an impulse,  
This was premeditated,  
I'll take the benevolent malignancy,  
At least you're dedicated,  
To remove her from this frame of mind,  
To dissociate the dissociatives  
From the dissociated.
