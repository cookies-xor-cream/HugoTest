Axiomatic Paradoxia: Where Health Itself Is The Disease

You're the paradessence of my
Bounded infinite decalescence,
You're the need to convalesce
In paroxysms of a paradoxical essence.

You're the noxia to ionia's nyx,
You're evidence of words in places
Which would do better investing
Into quarries of stones and stockpiles of sticks.

You're Io's gadfly, transvested as a zebra,
You're the insistence of the flea-market
That they've rebranded Anatolia, and now
They don't take Euros, no they only take Lira.

You're everything that never made sense,
You're a question mark stretching from the
Tip of my tongue, and up to my palette cleft,
A cuneiform dot, chiselled deep into my chest.

And it seems to me that pesky bug,
It found an answer to my question,
In the integration of a separation
Of the equs from the equestrian.

It lives between the crab and goat,
Between the Cancer and the Capricorn,
And that gadfly is a mosquito in camo,
A dengue-vector, I could've sworn...
