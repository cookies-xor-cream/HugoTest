A capillary killing is a  
death by thousand cuts,  
fractional incisions  
summating up to one.

You're not bleeding  
out with pressure,  
the red's diffusing out  
with leisure.

And if you asked me  
to place punctured strands,  
across your hands, I would  
know it as my pleasure.

It don't hurt, but it  
could warp the time  
if we paint so many  
scarlet lines across.
