What Is A Date? A Label, Or Something More?

"A rose by any other name would smell as sweet"

My head kept probing for riposte,
a long last encore of the day,
it wound up tongue-tied once again
on all of the nothing that I could say.

It asked what's there inside a name?
Well I've got a label maker for a heart,
and the spelling makes me decide,
on whether it runs, or stays sat tight.

What's there in a name?
Hope and conditional promises
that're driving me insane?
