Have you heard?  
Clancy of the overflow  
Died hazy in the undertow.  
I promise you if rain could kill  
What lies remnant of you still,  
It would pitter-patter you away  
Into the brink of your mortality,  
Edge you on the final inch of life.

It would wipe the vestiges away,  
Leaving nothing but a murder mystery  
That a storm cloud wrote for me.
