If Only You Stayed For 30 More Seconds
Today Reads Like A Novel,
I Wish Someone Had The First Draft

It takes so much for me to fall,
But traffic makes for good balistics,
Gives my soul the power needed,
Framed outside all the logistics.

My friend just missed the scene,
When she asked me, "are you drunk?",
And so I gave it my very best,
To convince her she's wrong.

Coz I'm looking for a daemon,
But she seems to me a dog,
That's not an insult in intent,
But a purpose that I robbed.

And if I meet her up in heaven,
And she told me she was god,
I wouldn't be the least surprised,
To see her with a sceptre or a rod.

Coz she pulled me out the path,
As the headlight high-beams
Stained my vision black.
So I looked her in the eye,
And I told her what she lacked
Was the general countenance
Befitting of a cat.
