The Halting Problem I/O U: Don't Insert 50c To Continue

This month, we're woodchippers,
I'm on a diet made of amberglass,
It made the fibrosis all displace,
From my lungs down to my hands.

I wonder if we've got any sentience,
I would argue you this final point,
And wager against our consciousness,
At wishing wells, well fed with coin.

Icy nickels hurt much to hold,
That's how it always goes I'm told,
However numb these tired hands,
The cold still plagues our dendric strands.

So maybe I'll jam your machine,
Give it bad polish, a dull new 'sheen',
Inserting dimes to vend out halts,
Behind a fibreglass protective screen.

The Halting Problem is now solved,
Under the constraint that she's fed in,
Because time, or change, (or just a couple cents)
Will put an end to this machine.

I wonder if my coin's well spent
Buying the end of your I/O curse,
The gadfly of existence is so brief
Once you have fiscal motive to leave.
