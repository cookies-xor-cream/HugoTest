"Hey... boy, what are you doing?"

"Waking up?"

"You're not asleep".

"You always tell me that in my dreams".

"Come back? Let's wake up together?"

She told me to just "sleep it off"
I asked her what she meant exactly,
And she said she means everything,
And said it so fucking nonchalantly.

---

"Sweetheart, I'm not gonna die,
I think it's high time we both clarify,
To feel this way, it ain't alright",
But my ramblings were only
A dulled and muffled noise.
The sounds I made were
Nothing more than the empty
Droning of an empty voice.

---

The buzz rang like
Tinnitus met tetanus
In causation,
Like a rusty nail
And a cochlear
Marriage's
Perforation.
