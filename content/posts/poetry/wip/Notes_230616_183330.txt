She told me to just "sleep it off"  
I asked her what she meant exactly,  
And she said she means everything,  
And said it so fucking nonchalantly.

"Sweetheart, I'm not gonna die,  
I think it's high time that we clarify,  
To feel this way, it ain't alright",

But my ramblings were only  
A dulled and muffled noise.  
The sounds I made were  
Nothing more than the empty  
Droning of an empty voice.

The buzz rang like  
Tinnitus met tetanus  
In causation.

Like a rusty nail  
And a cochlear  
Marriage's  
Perforation.
