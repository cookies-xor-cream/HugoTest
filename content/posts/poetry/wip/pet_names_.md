Athenian Arachnid,  
Little Woodlouse,  
The Amphibious Plague  
Of The Bubonic Mouse.

My Pneumonic Tremor,  
The Phlegm In My Lungs,  
The Black Cat Under Ladder,  
The Frostbite At The Tip Of My Tongue.

You told me that you hated it,  
that it was fucking unseemly,  
but when I called her those  
her smile would beacon gleaming.

It's been five years since,  
and I feel I've lost my charm,  
there's no two words that I can say,  
to make those teeth paint a moon upon my arm.
