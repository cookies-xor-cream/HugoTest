Drinking Until You Forget Means You Don't Feel Rejected The Next Morning And I Wanna Tell You So You Don't Do It A Third Time But I Wanna Save You The Embarassment More

Meet me on the curb, make your exit like a dove,
Gracious on a west wind, flown in from up above,
We'll plume up a steady string of dialogue,
Despite how we always forget all of our lines,
And you'll tap your watch twice back to back,
Call the curtains, followed by a subtle fade to black.
I miss the stupid way you'd slur your words,
How you drank yourself till cozied on the curb,
I missed the sobriety that you wouldn't try to kiss me,
Coz sweetheart, to be honest, I just miss the being heard.
