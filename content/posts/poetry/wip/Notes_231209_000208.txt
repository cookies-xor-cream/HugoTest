Scandal With The Former Curbing World Champion

Meet me on the curb, make your exit like a dove,
Gracious on a west wind, flown in from up above,
We'll plume up a steady string of dialogue,
Despite how we always forget all of our lines,
And you'll tap your watch twice back to back,
Call the curtains, followed by a subtle fade to black.
I miss the stupid way you'd slur your words,
How you drank yourself till cozied on the curb,
I missed the sobriety where you wouldn't try to kiss me,
Coz sweetheart, to be honest, I want only to be heard.
