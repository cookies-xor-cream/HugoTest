Death Is Just A Continuation Of Life Without The Self

She thought there was a solution to the halting problem,
In the form of a suicide, but she blundered,
I woke her up in a pool of her vomit,
Told her that rock bottom's now her new summit.

"I love you but don't know how to handle this,
Tell me you're already dead, so that I can pack my things",
But she told me that she never felt less free,
Like a message in a bottle, cinched onto the bottom of the sea.

I pincered her below her cheeks,
And told her that she had to speak,
But all the sound that she could make
Was "therapy don't do the trick for me,
The talking just won't take".

"Raconte-moi, tu t'attendes à quoi?"
"Peut-être ma vie, mais sans moi?"
