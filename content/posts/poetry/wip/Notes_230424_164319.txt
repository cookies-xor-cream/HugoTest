If I could go back to that beach,
Where your hair threads between the sand,
I'd wash it off your head, disregard the
Blood seeping from my hands.

You looked so peaceful in your sleeping,
Like an older sister that I never had,
But we made our choices, and we
And knew that our time would come to pass.

If I could go back to your bedroom floor,
I'd lock shut your drawer and your door.
The years we spent together, the year we've spent apart,
Is downwardly displaced, sinking to the bottom of my heart.

You voiced me your concerns,
That I'd never tell the story,
To finish from conception,
I'd call you, but my head's out of
Bandwidth and I've lost reception.
