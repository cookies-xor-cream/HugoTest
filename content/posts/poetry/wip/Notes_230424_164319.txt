If I could go back to that beach,
where your hair threads between the sand,
I'd wash it off your head, disregard the
exodus of blood from out my hands.

You looked so peaceful in your sleeping,
like an older sister that I never could've had,
but we made our choices, and we
knew that our time would come to pass.

If I could go back to your bedroom floor,
I'd lock shut your drawer and slam your door.
The years we spent together, and the year we've spent apart,
are downwardly displaced, sinking to the bottom of my heart.

You voiced me out your concerns,
that I'd never tell the story,
to finish from its conception,
I'd call you, but my head's out of
bandwidth, and I've lost reception.
