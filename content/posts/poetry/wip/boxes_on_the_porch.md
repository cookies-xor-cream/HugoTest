I thought that I would feel something, just a little bit at least,  
But my heart is empty as my head: that's the price of peace I guess.  
I don't feel numb, I don't feel at all, not even any form of void,  
For void implies that there is something of which I'm devoid.

And the only thing I lack is rope.  
Not to end a life, but to chase rock bottom down,  
To start descent forevermore.

I'm not emptied out, I simply leaked until I found I was no longer full,  
I hope that life deals you more than us, at least more than I did you,  
I hope life gives you what you deserved, that's the least that it can do.  
Or at least I pray it struck a chord, to deafen you, or mute the crude.

I hope the pills made the voices stop, like you deserved, this final try.  
I wasn't a history for looking back all I see is a sentence served, a shattered sky, in resin cast.  
I read the triple, but will burn the cards,  
For every word has gone unheard.

I'll write you over, I'll scribe a tale,  
A fable of the dread been dealt.
