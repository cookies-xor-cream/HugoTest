The Gospels Of Zopiclone

I wrote the gospels in my sleep,
Essays and short-form writing,
That I can't seem to read,
But each word sits there biting me.

They tell me how I feel,
I don't know how much I believe,
How much of it's delirium,
Passed from through a cosmic sieve.

But I guess I like the imagery,
And though I'm in love with the recounts,
I wouldn't make choices on their behalf,
Nothing based off their account.

As insightful as they might be,
I feel like I was born with a blindness,
And my pulse is the tapping of a cane,
That kills me with its likeness.

I lived so long so calculated,
But I'm listening to my heart instead,
Even if it fills my eyes with blood-beats,
I'd rather be seeing red than never see.
