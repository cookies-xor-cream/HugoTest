Happy Tears; If Being Overjoyed Was A Viable Cause Of Death, I Would've Died Today (Hit The LD50, Hit The LD100)

I love the rain, just want some thunder,
I'm more comfortable when my sleeves are longer,
So I wore my shirt, but that's a blunder,
The first layer's all I need.

But if you could scrape off a few degrees,
I'd be so happy, wearing long sleeves at ease,
I don't want to see the veins stuck in my forearms,
I want them to leave me be at peace.

An old lady caught me crying on the bus,
Said her husband died, and the book I had,
Reminded her of a time where she'd say 'us',
But that's stuck generations back, within the windy heights.

I meandered my way home,
Found the path of least resistance,
Because I was locked in daydream fugues,
Long enough to make the distance.
