Forgive Yourself, Shooting Star Albatross

You've boarded so many flights,
that have never come to land,
and you're split across every story arc,
I hope the pink is fading off the arches of your hands.

Coz each time you're shot out of the sky,
with each death you spend in a mortal crash,
a little bit of divine repentance,
is indiscriminately dispatched.
