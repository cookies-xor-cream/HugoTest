Over The Weekend I Saw Parisa, She Said You're Living With The Guilt: I Forget Everything, So Please Forgive Yourself

You Broke My Trust In You, But The Damage Was Self-Contained. I'm Happy, And You Can Be Happy Too

You've boarded so many flights,
that have never come to land,
and you're split across every story arc,
I hope the pink is fading off the arches of your hands.

Coz each time you're shot out of the sky,
with each death you spend in a mortal crash,
a little bit of divine repentence,
is indiscriminately dispatched.
