The Title Is What You Make Of It

Found her playing a gargoyle, an obsidian statue on the stairwell equipped with 'The Stranger'.

And that book was an accurate description of her, because that would be the first time we had an actual fucking conversation.

God, if my life was a joke
Then the punchline is caught
In the decade I spent,
All anxiety-wrought.

But I've been eating the time,
As it falls off the clock,
And I've been digesting the words
From the books that I bought.

I'd been feeling real haught
From the novels you brought,
Know the fire's misplaced,
Doesn't belong in our hearts.

And there are no volumes
Of Paul-Satre or Albert Camus,
That can fill up the hole
That I dug into you.
