The Title Is What You Make Of It

God, if my life was a joke
Then the punchline is caught
In the decade I spent,
All anxiety-wrought.

But I've been eating the time,
As it falls off the clock,
And I've been digesting the words
From the books that I bought.

I'd been feeling real haught
From the novels you brought,
Know the fire's misplaced,
Doesn't belong in our hearts.

And there are no volumes
Of Paul-Satre or Albert Camus,
That could fill up the hole
That I dug into you.
