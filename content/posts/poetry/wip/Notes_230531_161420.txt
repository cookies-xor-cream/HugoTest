The Borders Between The Moments We Share

She's an angel on the sun,
playing host to dying stars,
she sees the night eclipse
her with earth, it lets her be at ease.

For prying eyes, she has the lux,
not in darkness, but in light, she hides,
amidst the fiery storms,
the likes of which set on your eyes,
burning and forlorn.

I just want a night,
that's filled with the light,
from her column of flame,
that ignites as she bites.

I just want a day,
with the moon dropping in,
dangled drooping below,
in the stead of our sins.

I just want a river,
that sees the streamlines connect,
with navier-stokes solved,
and all proven correct.

So cry me a river,
with a methanol taste,
the impurity sees my
vision running with haste.

I just want a sea,
that drowns my soul out of me,
I want a pair of blank eyes,
to be blind and disguised.

To be set free of my sight,
for seeing's a blight.
I wanna be numbed out of sense,
to be unwinding the clock,
till it changes its tense,
till it tears down this fence.
