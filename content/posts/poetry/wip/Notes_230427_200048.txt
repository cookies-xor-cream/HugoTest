Thanks, Andrew, For The Lovely Dinner
A Confused Recount Of Today's Mania

My trousers carry the slit like a scar,
In reminder of a grounding in the parking lot,
Falling flat, floored besides her car,
I was bleeding through but guess they didn't notice it,
I should've taken it as a sign,
But my brain's disassembled itself,
And I'm missing some important bits.

I saw a friend alone tonight,
Felt less empty than I normally would,
Like I finally got something right.
I told him I'll jump into his porsche,
But in the irony I found oncoming traffic,
Didn't notice it,
Till a girl I knew came and pulled me out,
I should've taken it as a sign,
To wipe an expression far too placid,
And a little bit too proud.

Then she asked if she could pose a question,
I told her that now, I wasn't on the clock,
But her question was "could I buy you a drink",
And god I have all the time,
But I don't wanna sit and talk.

She remembered my name from a stray email,
She received five weeks ago,
Probably sitting stale in her unread.
We debated the ethics,
But forgot my utter lack of desire,
I find it hard to fall for people,
But I'm trying to fan that fire higher.

I saw another friend earlier today,
In a discussion about confrontation,
Whether any pair of people are better off at bay,
And god there's so much that I want to,
But I know I shouldn't say.

We ran into another yet,
And at first he waved to me,
And as much as I'd like to stay,
And see,
I had an appointment with the
Nightmare and a dream.
