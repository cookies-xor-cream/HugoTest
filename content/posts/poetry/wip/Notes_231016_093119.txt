Lying By Omission (Again)

This is starting to be a fucking trope.
And I'm starting to feel like this is some karmic retribution. Omission for the omitter, or something.

You put your chin on my shoulder,
Said that you liked my panache,
Sweetheart, you are on fire,
You're gonna burn us down into ash.

You said you liked my Inscriptions,
Asked me what do they say,
I suggested I give you a reading,
Recite scripture in a quieter place.

You bought us an ocean of whiskey,
Matched with a shot for a shot,
Said that I would go down,
That drink can't have you drowned.

Then you receded, quickly postured away,
Said that your boy couldn't make it out here today,
I asked why approach me, you gave me a hug,
Said that you're sorry, just got caught up in passing the time.

I asked why so receptive,
And so you gave me a tale,
Said that you're defenceless
When wit comes your way.

But, I don't have any wit,
I'm at my wit's end with you,
If the only requisite's to heckle
You'd flirt with half of the room.
