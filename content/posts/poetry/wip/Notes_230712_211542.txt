Red Tape Angel

Living's so much more paperwork,
Than almost every other decision,
But dying is somehow more,
You gotta sign for life's excision.

You've ticked all the boxes,
And you've crossed off all the t's,
You must be a red tape fucking angel,
Coz you told me that it's a breeze.

I stopped picking up your calls,
But she reminded me the deal,
So I got an unknown number,
And picked up to hear the spiel.

I asked who I had on the line,
You realised I removed your contact,
Made a joke about how fast I was
To delete, you and to retract.

You made some stupid comment,
Something like "I'm not dead yet",
But sweetheart, entertain me here,
And tell me the goddamn difference?

It's a fucking technicality.

Dead tomorrow and dead today...
Those two things aren't far apart.
The only distinction between them's
The fractures and fissures in my heart.
