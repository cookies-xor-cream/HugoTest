You lit up your last cigarette,  
I asked about your health,  
you said talk about that topic,  
was already overspent.

I asked about your scars,  
you asked about my scans,  
I asked about your wrists,  
and you asked about my hands.

You were meant to die,  
and a life ago no less,  
but you were here at 20,  
destroying me at chess.

I love your hallowed words,  
and I love the way you think,  
I miss too much of you  
every single time I blink.

I saw you at my window,  
then met you by the swings,  
we pretended we were teenagers,  
you needed one last win.
