First Day Of My Life

Ive got 21 years in custody,
Trying their best to stall,
But the firing squad's arrived,
And is lined against the wall.

It's not an execution,
Let's just call it a salute,
A gun for every year,
But the calibre: you can choose.

This is traditional for the funeral,
But this shot's so fucking clear,
We can host the wake right after,
Right damn fucking here.

We'll dress up on a weekday,
We'll be hosting this at noon,
Now whichever god can hear me,
Should make clear of this room.

We'll put the years
Inside a jacket,
With kevlar-adjacent
Fibre woven in.

I just want to know,
If it'll take the impact,
Or the arteries will be
Bursting at the seams.

Either way I think this violence,
Is a conclusion to this dream,
A scrapbook collaged with a nightmare
Of a marathon, the longest that I've seen.
