Every Place I Should've Left Sooner: Sunsequent Attempts Where Quiting Would Suffice

Hope Where Nothing Should Be

Every XRay I Never Got Caught Up To Me

I don't understand the aversion,
But I do understand the avarice,
Of falling from the red-bricked rooftop,
And out into the terrace.

I slept for a moment, and then
Dusted myself off the ground,
Melaka felt like a little slice,
Of the oranges she found.

A strange etymology for a place,
To name it after a plantation,
That's not a decision you make,
Unless you're on every medication.

Strapped in stagnant thought on the patio,
Being stared down by those widened eyes,
The town was smeared with off-red clay,
As if hosting or manifesting a permanent fire.

I made my way to the foyer,
I put my things atop the shoerack,
Amalgamations of coins and pictures,
That were messy but still barely stacked.

I was missing from the frames,
And so were all of my friends,
I knew that I'd leave soon enough,
And thought I'd rend the bitter end.

We were drinking on her roof,
I watched her fall the whole two metres,
And was hit with this stupid urge,
That told me: "don't stay seated".

So I followed her lead with ethanol eyes,
Two to make it a one-take topple,
Landing surrounding the rake,
Taking the fall from a single to a double.

A half metre out and we'd have impaled,
The worst of us on the garden tools,
That overstayed the autumn welcome,
And were stubborn in their sad misuse.

I slept for an encore, and picked myself up,
Reincarnating with my ribcage compressed,
From my back to my heart,
But I told myself that it slowly depressed.

But she couldn't get off the floor,
I remember feeling nothing at all,
And that was the kill confirm,
That I should see to the door.

But I stayed where I was,
Like a fool in a lake,
That was freezing in place,
It'd take more than one take.
