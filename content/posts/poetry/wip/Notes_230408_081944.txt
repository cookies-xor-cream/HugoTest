Every Place I Should've Left Sooner: Sunsequent Attempts Where Quiting Would Suffice

Hope Where Nothing Should Be

Every XRay I Never Got Caught Up To Me

I don't understand the aversion,  
but I do understand the avarice,  
of falling from the red-bricked rooftop,  
and out into the terrace.

I slept for a moment, and then  
dusted myself off the ground,  
Melaka felt like a little slice,  
of the oranges she found.

A strange etymology for a place,  
to name it after a plantation,  
that's not a decision you make,  
unless you're on every medication.

Strapped in stagnant thought on the patio,  
being stared down by those widened eyes,  
the town was smeared with off-red clay,  
as if playing host to a permanent fire.

I made my way to the foyer,  
I put my things atop the shoerack,  
amalgamations of coins and pictures,  
that were messy but still coarsely stacked.

I was missing from the frames,  
and so were all of my friends,  
I knew that I'd leave soon enough,  
and thought I'd rend the bitter end.

We were drinking on her roof,  
I watched her fall the whole two metres,  
and was hit with this stupid urge,  
that told me: "don't stay seated".

So I followed her lead with ethanol eyes,  
two to make it a one-take topple,  
landing surrounding the rake,  
taking the fall from a single to a double.

A half metre out and we'd have impaled,  
the worst of us on the garden tools,  
that overstayed the autumn welcome,  
and were stubborn in their sad misuse.

I slept for an encore, and picked myself up,  
reincarnating with my ribcage compressed,  
from my back to my heart,  
but I told myself that it slowly depressed.

But she couldn't get off the floor,  
I remember feeling nothing at all,  
and that was the kill confirm,  
that I should see to the door.

But I stayed where I was,  
like a fool in a lake,  
that was freezing in place,  
it'd take more than one take.
