The answer's that I don't,
it's just the stories with the boys,
only ever last one night,
so they are never told.

Coz they say they say the
wrong things at the worst times,
skirt around my boundaries,
redrawing every line.

Like in a middle of a story,
they interject with "did you fuck her",
could you please not use that word?
it makes my skin crawl and my
heart defer away.

Lest it land somewhere close
enough to break.

But they'd love to see the shatter scene
in a single fucking take,
and come to think of it,
why do I still think "wouldn't they?".
