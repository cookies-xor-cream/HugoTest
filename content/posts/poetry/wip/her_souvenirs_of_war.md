My vision's cinched to my eyes,
My eyes are victim to gore,
Being lead by the lines
Of the skin that she tore.

From shoulder to hand,
Each successive demand,
Is an instance of harm,
At a self-loathing command.

My gaze is riveted on
That place on her wrist,
That's painted with blood
From that last violent tryst.
