The Watcher: The Eulogies I Never Gave, For All The Ones Who Didn't Die

Hazel sat in waiting, smoking on the hood,
She saw me flitter in the distance,
Came up with her palms held high,
Expecting some resistance.

Told me that she won't touch a hair,
Told me that no one here would hear her wail,
So whatever that she might've tried,
Could come with a price when she might fail.

I told her I wasn't scared,
I commanded her to ease,
I stepped onto the grass,
And told her that I come in peace.

She told me she can't help herself,
That she saw me on the street,
And convinced herself to follow me,
For a single final meet.

She asked me for a story,
She asked me for a history,
She didn't want to fly from here,
With her baggage filled with mystery.

So I started at the start,
On the condition that she leave,
Coz, Marlene, with you, there's
No more courage left to steal.

She was happy I recalled,
That I remembered her real name,
But what's there in a name?
She's the same girl either way.

She held onto that fixation,
So I interleaved it into what I had to say,
I talked about the life I passed,
Every daydream and every day I had.

And when the sun rose on the hill,
She intertwined our fingers,
Said, "just as friends, I swear,
I wouldn't dare to pull this trigger".

And there was some comfort in the thought,
That my telling could have reached her,
Coz it had been at least an hour,
Since she played with the ring upon her pointer finger.

And I knew that we were done,
So I got up, prepared to part,
But she wrapped me in embrace so tight,
That I swear that I could hear her heart.

She told me to stand tall,
Said that she was deeplly sorry,
To be the footnote in a paragraph,
To such an awful story.

And I told her we broke even,
I wiped the last conclusive leaking tear,
And she offered me a ride,
But I told her that I'd walk from here.

And she seemed so distraught,
I suppose it's a heavy tale,
And it took a decade to not relive it,
For the story to turn stale.

But it was fresh inside her head,
Creviced in the annals of her mind,
Shedding fibres from the rope,
That lacked the tension for a bind.

Why do I feel like I have tethered her,
When I broke the shackles, set her loose,
Why do I feel like my monologue,
Was a flare strapped to a fuse?

So stuck inside that thought,
I thought it only fair to ask,
But when I did she made it cannon,
By removing both her hands.

She told me that she saw me,
And she told me that she cared,
Then she said, "I'll stay away,
No matter how that you might fare".

This was the chance that I was hoping for,
To tie up each loose end,
Looks like the road was always straight,
I was hallucinating bends.

This was my final cadence,
Of this out of place confession,
And I think that it would shatter me,
If I ever attempted a last revision.

Because reliving all that time,
And redrawing all those lines,
Is something that leaves me feeling
Anything but fine.
