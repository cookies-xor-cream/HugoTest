Reading Into Old Wound Scrawlings

She asked if I'd been cheating,  
I told her the bleeding was my doing,  
That I'm happy I don't scar,  
Or at least haven't done so far.

I asked her of the baby,  
Why she event named it,  
And why that when she did,  
She chose to do it after me.

She told me that I never  
Left her any scars.  
No parting words or  
Sharp remarks.

No knife-edge marks when  
I embarked, or at least  
I haven't done so far.

The kid was gonna be  
living its existence  
as a scar.
