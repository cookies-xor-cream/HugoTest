She Keeps Saying "We Fractured My Wrists" Like It Was A Team Effort

Well The Doctor Gave Me Instructions

His hands on my waist, followed promptly by me falling on the floor of my own home.

I remember waking once from a blackout,
Anxious for the grip that won't give out.

We splashed your hand with black and blue,
I had a few tips to loosen my wrists, so I detailed them out for you.

But you didn't give a shit, said that the pain I wore,
Wasn't mine, that you'd sit with me on the bedroom floor.

You said you weren't comfortable hurting me,
But I'm not comfortable with breaking your hands honey.

If you're going to be rolling in the fire,
You better plan to be rolling in the sand.

Coz in that state I'm deaf and gagged,
And the least we could do is pull my fangs.

And I'm more scared now that it'll happen twice,
Coz my wrists don't hurt, but now they're a vice.

They used to get tired, but they don't anymore,
And if I hurt another avoiding self-injury, then what was it all for?

I can now hold the contraction, stop hurting myself,
But I wish I could bottle this pain and save it on the shelf.
