It's funny to read these old things back,  
So long here after the fact,  
It's funny to see how the sky can crack,  
But fossilise to stay intact.

If I could cull my thoughts, I would,  
Not for the falsity that I think of you,  
But to fabricate a bad excuse  
For a heart that tried at what it could never do.
