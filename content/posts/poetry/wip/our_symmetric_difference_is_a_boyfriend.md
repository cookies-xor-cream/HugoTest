You're smart, maybe a little too quick,  
You're halfway through your second bachelor's degree,  
Needed a change from your former undergrad,  
So you did pharmacology then switched to math.

You told me pure was your favourite branch.  
And said that you loved Cantor,  
Understand all the jokes I make,  
And Elizabeth, though you're perfect,  
Let's keep this thing crystal clear,  
We can't start this with bad terms on a break.

You may be funny, but holy shit, buddy,  
A little comedy is less than what it takes?  
(For me or for you, the words cut either way)
