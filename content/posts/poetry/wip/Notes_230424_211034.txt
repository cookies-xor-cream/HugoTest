Slow Burns Blooming Into Paroxysms

A Form Of Communication I'm Intimately Unfamiliar With

Someone teach me to be fucking angry openly,
I wanna learn to hold a grudge please,
My friends hold words like pistols,
But all I have poison up my sleeves.

--

Sometimes I wish that she
Taught me how to scream,
Coz I think the more I let out,
The less that goes back in.

But we spent the decade calm,
As silent as we could be,
Our diaphragms aren't made for sound,
All they fucking do is breathe.

But I'm bottling the pain,
A latent lifetime in the making,
Winding back a haymaker,
With the brunt of the abuse
That I've been retroactively taking.
