Slow Burns Blooming Into Paroxysms

Secrets are a form of communication that I'm intimately unfamiliar with.

Someone teach me to be fucking angry openly,
I wanna learn to hold a grudge please,
my friends wield words like pistols,
but all I have poison up my sleeves.

---

Sometimes I wish that she
taught me how to scream,
coz I think the more I let out,
the less that goes back in.

But we spent a decade in the calm,
as silent as we could be,
our diaphragms weren't made for sound,
all they fucking do is help us breathe.

But I'm bottling the pain,
a latent lifetime in the making,
winding back a haymaker,
with the brunt of the abuse
that I've been retroactively taking.
