There Are Buildings Smarter Than I Am

I have all the aptitude
Of a botched bit of brickwork,
My brain is fucking bricked,
It can't seem to want to work.

And I bet I still couldn't beat
The weathered stone and mortar
Even in a game of memory,
Where it's got the recall of a stoner.

That is to say, unless it has
Been chiselled or been chipped.
The only past that it can see,
Is the dulling of a makeshift shiv,
and etching agony.
