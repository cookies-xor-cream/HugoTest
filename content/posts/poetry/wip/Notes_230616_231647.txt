There Are Buildings Smarter Than I Am

I have all the aptitude  
of a botched bit of brickwork,  
my brain is fucking bricked,  
it can't seem to want to work.

And I bet I still couldn't beat  
the weathered stone and mortar  
even in a game of memory,  
where it's got the recall of a stoner.

That is to say, unless it has  
been chiselled or been chipped.  
the only past that it can see,  
is the dulling of a makeshift shiv,  
and etching agony.
