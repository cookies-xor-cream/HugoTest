"I think I should take it as a sign  
That the best in you brings out  
The worst in us.  
That the closer you meander,  
The further I tear apart, the more  
I rip asunder.  
I'm not filler, I didn't give you keys  
To let you in, I gave them to you to  
Set me free.  
I want to see you, but not this often,  
But you'll hold no record of me if I  
Wait until next quarter.  
I thought that options were deterence,  
But they only facilitate the missing time,  
And all of its transference".
