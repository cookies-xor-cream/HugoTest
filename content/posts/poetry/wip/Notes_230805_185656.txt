Everyone On The Bus Can Tell; Summer Is Gonna Kill Me This Year

You can tell by the way the autumn falls,
This season was only meant to stall,
You can tell by the way the figs all fell,
I'm a wasp breaking out a fruit-clad shell.

They can tell by the way she twists her words,
Your tongue is wedlock to the dirt,
They can tell by the way I ration them,
I don't have a chance in hell with her.
