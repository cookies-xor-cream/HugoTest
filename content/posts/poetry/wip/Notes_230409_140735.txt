I Lived A Decade In A Day, And Forgot All Of It

Does What I Feel Dictate What I Remember Or Is It The Other Way Around?

But, It Doesn't Matter, Does It?

There's a crack in the hourglass,  
and the sand can find the other side,  
so it runs from the bottom rung onto the ground,  
it never planned to stay inside for long.

Time is always wearing thin,  
but if you want to, you could eat the sand,  
then it'd stay in you forever, just pick up  
a spoon, don't use your hands.

Time is poison on your skin,  
and the broken glass acts as a blade,  
that opens scars on idle hands,  
that are never meant to fully fade.

She asked me the questions,  
I had no answers to show,  
for her full name, her birthday,  
or her favourite places to go.

I'd etch the answers into my wrists,  
but the shards smashed out the hourglass,  
don't cut me the same as I've seen others flayed,  
there's no "I wish you stayed", I heal over that too fast.

I can't really fathom the conditional mood,  
if the tense you're in is in the past.  
(That line of thinking can never last).
