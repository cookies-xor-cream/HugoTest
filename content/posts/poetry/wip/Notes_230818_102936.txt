The Girl At The Hardware Store Said I Looked Like I Was Living A Woodchipper Of A Week. I Bought Her Coffee But She Laughs At Too Many Jokes So I Left Before She Could Ask My Contact

I don't like the verbiage
Of calling me jaded,
It's the third time this week,
And I'm starting to dissolve.

I'm misplaced baggage,
Faded from memory,
Once it has been mislabelled,
It sits in wait to be discarded.

I prefer the adage that
The death are free but
The waiting all are
Existence-addled.

I'm missing the equipment,
Paraphernalia to meet her,
But I'll buy a rope and a
Step-stool or a ladder later.
