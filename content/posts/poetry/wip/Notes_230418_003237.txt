I Guess I Won The 'Most Improved' Trophy: I Wish Max Could Have It Instead, But I Don't Give Enough Of A Fuck To Help Him Anymore

They all act like I had to move heaven and earth to forget and forgive, and forfeit these memories.

But I never even tried, I just held my breath and counted down the time I needed to live instesd of just having to survive.

He said he wanted closure,
And all his questions answered,
But really he wanted butterflies and honey,
But the sacharrides only bring bodyflies,
And he's festering a corpse.

He scrambled through the pages,
Dismissing the heavy drizzle-drainage,
And all the rest of the liquid damage,
He went to speak but every word he squeezed out
I sniped out of flight with my steely gaze.

I want to help him but I'm too far removed,
Hannah was never here, and Amber has since moved,
I'm all that he has left but he's searching for a ghost,
But it's been too long, and I have found repose.

Pack your things, pick your clothes,
You're stuck guarding an empty post,
We're abandoned at this dinner party,
By the cadaver of the memory of the host.
