Her "Why Do You Never Let Me" Answered With Blank And Obvious Looks

Fistfuls of flannel,
Retroactive remarks,
Claims that you love me,
From a shape in the dark.

Your shirt in my hand,
Placed onto your back,
Now that you're done,
I can finally relax.

Ask to continue,
And know I'll reject,
You're libido incarnate,
That pain can never eject.
