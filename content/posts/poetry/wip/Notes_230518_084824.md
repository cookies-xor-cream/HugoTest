Sins Of A Fairy

Some Things Even Time Can't Chip Away: What You Did Is One Of Those Things

There'a thing I feel helplessly
And violently till the end,
So I still feel the way I did,
But now I need you out my view.

Every feeling that I catch,
Seems to infinitely last,
So despite what's in my heart,
This dislike will never come to pass.

The hate like a disease,
Is spreading from you to me,
Just this time now,
Love won't put it at ease.
