Supply And Demand: My Only Drinking Problem Is A Caffeine Dependency, But I Prefer To Think Of That As A Failure To Price At Equilibrium

It's so ironic that it wasn't the same for her yet she criticises me. Funny, nevertheless.

The $s are silent.

"What payment's fair to hear her voice, that quiet whimper, one time more?"

"$4.50 twice is all the change an encore of her would ever take"

"And why is that the price, why that twice and not $9 once?"

"Because she'll see me with a second cup, stranded to my own device, and gone awry"

"But were she here, she could fight, coffee deferred with fear and might?"

"Without a fight. She's got whatever say, whichever right"

"Without a fight...? You'd just give up?"

"Oh, 'Giving up' isn't name for compromise,
If she has ears, then I have eyes,
If she has teeth then I have hands,
It's an equivalent exchange,
Not for senses, but for demand."
