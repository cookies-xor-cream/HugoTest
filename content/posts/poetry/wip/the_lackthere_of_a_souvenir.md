Got a call past midnight,  
That she was across the road,  
And too drunk for machinery,  
So she needed a pilot for her car.

So I drove her the way home,  
Confiscated those stupid keys,  
And joined her in the drinking,  
With them stowed 2ply in my pocket,  
Hiding there, betwixt the seams.

And when I gave them back,  
I cracked open wide my wallet,  
And she asked me why I kept  
A stupid picture of a stupid bin.

Well. My life is... weird?  
Simultaneously episodic,  
And never context-free.  
But this snapshot doesn't  
Remind me of anything.

The sentiment in the image,  
Is no sentiment at all.  
My life's a string of loosely  
Tangled up webbing of events.

And sometimes nothing is what I need.
