I'm addicted to words,  
And most of all her's.  
She says sorry for rambling,  
But I live for her slurs.

We missed out the Saturday ring,  
Guess she got lost in drinks,  
So does this red "disconnect",  
Mean to come back and collect?

Well, I tried to tax her today,  
But her bill's still unpaid,  
She knows she owes me a tale,  
Or she'll see her finances flayed.
