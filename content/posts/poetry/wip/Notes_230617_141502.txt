Between Everything And Nothing? I Guess I'm Forced To Choose Nothing

"Come inside, make yourself at home,
It's raining out, I can't just let you roam alone".

*"If I step inside, I'll stay the night,*
*And I need to make it home tonight".*

"I'll get you blankets, whatever you might need,
We'll take turns at taking showers, you could
Go first and use up all the heat?"

*"You're pretty smart, so tell me sweetheart,*
*If we have a coffee, and we take a seat,*
*Do you think that I could leave?"*

"I'm not asking for forever, I'm not
Overextending my reach.
I only asked for a single night,
And a morning I could steal".

*"I would love more than anything,*
*To wake up here, but I know better,*
*And I'm certain I can make it home.*
*So let's dot the i's and abandon this last letter".*

"This feels like I'm accounting,
Cooking books I'll be stuck
Fixing up this ledger, but boy,
I'm a chooser, not a beggar".
