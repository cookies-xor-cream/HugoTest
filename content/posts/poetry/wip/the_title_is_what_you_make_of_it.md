God, if my life was a joke  
then the punchline is caught  
in the decade I spent,  
all anxiety-wrought.

But I've been eating the time,  
as it falls off the clock,  
and I've been digesting the words  
from the books that I bought.

I'd been feeling real haught  
from the novels you brought,  
know the fire's misplaced,  
doesn't belong in our hearts.

And there are no volumes  
of Paul-Satre or Albert Camus,  
that could fill up the hole  
that I dug into you.
