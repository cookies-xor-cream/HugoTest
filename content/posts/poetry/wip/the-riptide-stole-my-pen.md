I cracked my pen nib,
drawing a cleft unto my lip,
so that when my tongue slipped,
my words had somewhere left to spill.

But little did I know,
they had nowhere left to go,
and the cut that I had made,
now infinitely grows.

I've got ink stuck to my mouth,
and pencil lead in my hand,
and when either one comes out,
they float on the river where they'll land.

But there's no littering on the bridge,
I read the sign, it's still sinking in,
so help me grab a hairclip,
to put a pin in it.
