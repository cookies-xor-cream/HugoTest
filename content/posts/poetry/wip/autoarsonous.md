Not for abundance of temperature, but for revival as fuel

Gracious indignation,  
came as hellish immolation,  
turned me into a pyre,  
a hobbled hostess of this fire.

For I only have my anima,  
in the form of frenzied mania,  
for I had lost my animus,  
in the molting of my husk.  
lost it inside disgrace  
that I never could've faced,  
or put aside.

Alude, elide,  
separate.  
Fissure the fixture  
found inside.

But if I can't fly  
and I can't glide,  
what have I remnant  
of the sky to find?

What ceiling blues could  
ever hide from me and  
cache away from you?
