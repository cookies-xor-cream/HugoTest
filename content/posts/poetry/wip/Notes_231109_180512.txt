I Gave Her The Wrong Number By Mistake But After Running Into Her Today I Realised I Dodged A Bullet: She'd Rather I Give Her Attention Than Help Someone Struggling With Their Trolley (Solopsistic Asshole, I Hope You Develop A Motor Disorder And No One Offers You Any Assistance)

Vanya, I wish you had cerebral palsy,
And I wish that lady there did as well,
Maybe it wouldn't be fucking fair,
But at least you'd have offered help,
Just maybe then you would fucking care,
Try to understand, don't idly stand and stare.

I was so fucking close to having a quiet day,
Why the fuck did you have to grace it with your lack of empathy?
