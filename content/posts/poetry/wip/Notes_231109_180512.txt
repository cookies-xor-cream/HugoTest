Gotta Love Ableism

Vanya, I wish you had cerebral palsy,
And I wish that lady there did as well,
Maybe it wouldn't be fucking fair,
But at least you'd have offered help,
Just maybe then you'd fucking care,
Try to understand, don't idly stare and stand.

I was so fucking close to having a quiet normal day,
Why the fuck did you have to grace it with your lack of empathy,
Why did you have to inch me closer to 'jaded' and 'dismayed'?
