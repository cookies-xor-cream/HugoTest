You Knew The Rules: You Should've Asked To Sedate Me First

Go home, your kid must miss you

It's been a hell of a week,
I need some brandy and a walk,
And honestly more than anything,
I need you to tag along.

How is it I hear your voice,
In the vacancy of all human noise,
It seems your timbre's trapped,
Glued to the rustle of my clothes.

I need for this to end,
This chapter wrote itself
Into a close.

But if you knocked me out,
Then you could write the finish,
You could do with me what you wanted,
You could have the ending,
With neither of us pensive or haunted
I suppose.
