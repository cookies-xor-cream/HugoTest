I asked the nurse a stupid question.
She didn't respond. She didn't care.
She was far too busy, too enthralled
With panic and mortal dreaming to
Remember anything of language.

She didn't only forget TO speak.
She forgot HOW to speak.
And as the grunted to no effect,
And bloodloss took hold,
My head found itself somewhere it wasn't.

My head started to piece together
A really shitty essay,
Not because I'm shit (though I am),
But because anything missing
This many fucking litres is.

Anyways, you could say there was a
Language barrier between us.

I feel like that nurse sometimes,
Especially talking to you now.

Speaking with you is so seamless,
So easy that I notice the wrinkling with others.

Funeral Magnet

There is a language barrier,
Stuck between me, and reality.
I'm never quite certain I'm awake.
And never fully lucid, dreaming.

I've tried so many times,
To find abyss between the two,
But I suppose that's a prize,
Hereby won and left to you.

Every route you try's a beacon,
An in via ex machina deus attractor,
And if god really is mechanical,
He'd kiss the ferrum out your fucking skull,
Like a lead-encased 12mm method actor.

You don't live days. You die them.
Every day lived is a day removed.
I suppose that your drinking
Is the hardest fucking proof.

You said that you had read my essay,
But I remember when I wrote it at fourteen,
And there's nothing that you stand to learn,
Not From that rendition of me.
