Funeral Magnet

There is a language barrier,  
Stuck between me, and reality.  
I'm never quite certain I'm awake.  
And never fully lucid dreaming.

I've tried so many times,  
To find an abyss between the two,  
But I suppose that that's a prize,  
Hereby won and left to you.

Every route you try's a beacon,  
An in via ex machina deus applicator,  
And if god really is mechanical,  
He'd kiss the ferrum out your fucking skull,  
Like a lead-encased 12mm method actor.

You don't live days. You die them.  
Every day lived is a morning removed.  
I suppose that your drinking  
Is the hardest, most blatant fucking proof.

You said that you had read my essay,  
But I remember when I wrote it at fourteen,  
There's nothing that you stand to learn,  
Not From that sorry rendition of a 'me'.
