Fire And Brimstone

I would move the heavens,  
I would level the earth,  
I would see continents all  
swallowed by the seven seas,  
come as payment and retribution,  
from the devil, punishment for life  
could rip you away from me?  
Could you stay me tonight?

Please stay you me,  
I need to see,  
if this is all  
we could ever be.
