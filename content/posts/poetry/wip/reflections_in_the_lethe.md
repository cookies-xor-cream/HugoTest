Sorry I had to catch you off guard,
Like a Narcissus by the waterside,
But I would love to head inside,
Venture to where the chiral 'us' might hide.

My hand's healing now, it's sure but slow,
I'm putting levo where dextro goes,
I'm waiting till my right hand's back,
Till every knuckle in comfort cracks.

A rose called by another name,
Is in its nature still a rose.

So why is it when my name's transposed,
My stubborn ghosts must then erode?
