Hi, I just wanted to say I don't think that I could invest in you this way,  
I don't know if my heart's got the energy in it to start this up again,  
And I know the hypocrisy in the fact that I'm doing the same somewhere else,  
But I suppose the difference is that you're you and they're someone else.  
So really, I am sorry kid, this is all I have left in me to do,  
Our only way around is, and always has been, past and never through.
