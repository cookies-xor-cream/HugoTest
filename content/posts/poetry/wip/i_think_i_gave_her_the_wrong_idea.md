There's nothing here,  
but I feel at home,  
swear I've walked this road  
about a thousand times before.

So next time when  
you're coming down,  
could you call me please  
before you get to town?

I can't do these  
midnight walks,  
the impromptu haunts,  
and yearly stalks.

But still I caught you  
in suggestion's joke,  
now the hollow hope  
has got you strung out, broke.

This consumption  
of your feeling,  
is sitting undigested,  
stuck forever seething, fleeting.

I've got you  
catching hope,  
that I'm so fucking  
far from feeling.

Would you feel  
the warmth receding,  
inside my salted wounds,  
and boundless bleeding?

Coz every time  
that I meet you  
I leave your clothes painted:  
a permanent rosy hue.

And you're angry  
with wrath atangled,  
that I'd see the 'friend'  
in our friendship mangled.

You said that if I had thought it,  
I had no business unthinking anything,  
but the harder I try to catch the feelings,  
the deeper I feel nothing instead.
