She's got this finesse,
She's got this panache,
For doctored circumstance
And makeshift happenstance.

She's got an inclination,
For malpracticed orchestration,
For turning any situation
Into our pairwise desolation.

Alone with her by chance
Happens solely by her command,
Fate hasn't half a hand
To restrain or reprimand.

And time hasn't half a mind,
For what it is that I might find,
If I dethread the loom and unwind
These kinks we find in space and time.

If I could go back to a Thursday that has long since passed,
I'd assess my doctrine, doctored to match the task at hand,
A breakup with a friend I've never even acquainted, never met,
A folly made of her and of our dear and barrenly-laid kismet.
