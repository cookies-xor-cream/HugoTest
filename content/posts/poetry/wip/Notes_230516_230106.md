The Ocean Has Teeth Trapped In It's Techtonics  
You know that feeling that you have,  
When you meet the fleeting flicker  
Of a passing glance, that speaks to you,  
Says you've missed your chance?  
Well I'd mark your hand, but I'm defanged,  
And my lockjawed maw upon your wrist,  
Would only serve reminders of flavours missed,  
Of blood, and salt, and silty wounds,  
That surface from the ocean, from their tombs.  
And I don't think I have the room  
For another bite if it's of you,  
I'm just praying the undertow  
Pulls me to the overpass where  
You can't go.
