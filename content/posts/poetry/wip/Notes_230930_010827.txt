When The Cat Started Biting Me I Didn't Even Think To Stop Him, This Past Month You Accustomed Me To Dentistry And Bleeding. Bite Marks Are Gorgeous, Aren't They? I Need To Rummage The Cabinets For Iodine.

The cat bit me tonight. His teeth are sharper than yours.

He's a cat, afterall. But where his cut and pierce. Yours only gnash.

Whatever this feeling might be, I want a fucking egress, however brash.
