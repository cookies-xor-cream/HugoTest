There's a persian expression for 'I love you'
Jigareto bokhoram: 'I will eat your liver'

I think the language is slowly getting soured for me. Parisa spoke farsi when she... (I'm not going to finish this sentence).

Amber spoke farsi when we... (nor am going to finish this one).

My neighbour and I spoke it, my dad's native dialect actually.

I think watching the movie hurt not because it reminded me of Euphie or anyone else in particular.

It hurt because I had to watch the main character be a fucking idiot. He let being scared take so much away from him.

I had to watch him waste all his time left with her. I've made a lot of stupid stupid decisions. I've wasted more time before funerals than I thought existed on the clock.

But at the very least, I got to end things relatively complete. I talked to her virtually every day before she died. Nothing really got in the way. I don't think either of us were scared of ourselves or each other.

It doesn't matter if I'm mid-surgery. It doesn't matter if the hospital staff is playing switch-board operative with her canulars.

We talk regardless.

But the boy in the movie... she dies whilst he's still afraid and withdrawn, before he can commit without the skip in his heart.

What I am most afraid of is being afraid itself. Fear is born more in thought than in feeling, it seems to me.
