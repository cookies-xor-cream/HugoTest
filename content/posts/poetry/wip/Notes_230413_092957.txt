Pulling The Plug: This Was Meant To Be Episodic

I keep writing sequels to the sequels,
Where no second story goes,
Chronology's the answer to the question asked
In the form of a four-year long shaped hole.

I skipped over Laura, for the most part anyhow,
She just had more gravity then than she does now,
One day I'd like to write through every year,
But I feel like I'm living faster than the transcript might allow.

So I'm calling it, and giving up,
The shit's not even ordered now,
We've missed Hannah for the most part,
And now we're shy a Daniella.

I guess it's not short form anymore,
When it hits a readtime of two hours,
I wish I could put the nuance in a single sentence,
But I don't have that power.
