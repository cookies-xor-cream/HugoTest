Any Metal, If You Polish Enough (Desolder Me Or Send Me Up In Plumes)

Keep doing what you're doing,
I swear to you that the pain will subside,
Went from "I wanna die" to "it's so gorgeous to live",
Like I found a dying volcano,
And I chose to live inside.

The group of them said something,
I can't quite remember the words,
But I remember the gist of the complaining,
That I'm going too fast but living too slow,
That I love alchemy reversed,
Making tin out of gold.

I'd mark up the thought,
But it's long since been sold.
