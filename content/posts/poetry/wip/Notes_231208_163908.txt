If We Exchanged Emails

Dear Whatever You Were,

This isn't love, it's jealousy, some envy way more verdant than the south coast greenery.

You always know just what to say to make her crack a smile, I wish that I could be her if only just one time.

But I know that you've got bigger fish to fry, and so I took it on myself to burden a final try for a goodbye.

Sincerely,  
Whatever I Was, And Everything I Will Never Be Next Time
