Stuck In A Tired Ontology Of This Godforsaken Building And Its Inhabitants

Felt like there was spit in your voice sent over the phone
In your "have fun with new girl", I wish I was alone,
She talked to my 'friend' and she camped at my desk,
I guess fuck my repose, I can't ask for rest in this place.
