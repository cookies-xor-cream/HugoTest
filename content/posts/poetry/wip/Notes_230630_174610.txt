Maat The Arbiter Got Checkmated: Worthless Golden Dreams

I've got roses in the closet,  
And essays in my drawer,  
Of what it means to me  
When the reaper takes a life.

I've got grapevines in my hand,  
And a wine glass on the counter,  
So siphon my viscera,  
For this final encounter.

And if we get the angel tipsy,  
Maybe we can talk him out,  
To rehabilitate the dying,  
Instead of making them hell-bound.

He was made to schism,  
But I swear to you this chasm,  
It could never run the length,  
So please sit tight, we only need to wait.

I'll meet you at the gates,

Your heart, still bloody,  
Clutched in a jackal's grip,  
Dropped onto the scales,  
And they were starting to tip.

Give me a blackboard,  
And a stick worth of chalk,  
I've shit I need to say,  
So please just let me talk.

I've got proof here of bias,  
Find the truthless in maat,  
See the plume that you chose,  
It isn't honesty's cut.

If purity's the measure,  
Just ask all of her friends,  
In fact, I've spared you the effort,  
And I've sent for myself.
