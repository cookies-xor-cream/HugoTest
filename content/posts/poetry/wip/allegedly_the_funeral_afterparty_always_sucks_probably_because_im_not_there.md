Sate and satiate to hound and berate,  
Criticise me for both of our tastes,  
Fuck me, we're in this thing together,  
But it never feels like that, grim dweller,  
It's never 'us', just you and also me sometimes,  
And the reaper when he decided to try,  
To do his fucking job and come to take a life.

We're like a mistake on purpose, or something in that vein,  
We're living in a necrocracy, or some equivalent reign.
