that she's merely a machine,  
she's an insignia, a symbol,  
of what she used to be.

I remember coalescence,  
to be singular in pain, in vain.  
like a crane made up of vertebrae,  
tripping over, slowly going lame.

What's in her label, if not her essence,  
do you feel her vacant nameless presence,  
in this abstinent drawn out persistence,  
And if you feel it so, then can it be consistent?

It's not a hit, but it's not a miss,  
my head won't make the distance,  
with this anachronistic heart  
putting up much resistance.

It's not a palm, but it's not a fist,  
it's the hothead's catching fire,  
do we join to play this ritual?  
do we acquiesce the pyre?
