The confusion  
Of departure,  
Is with tenses,  
Not with vultures.

I could watch the  
Buzzards all encircle,  
The site of a ritualistic  
Euthanasia or a murder.

But I will find myself  
Inside the tension  
Of a post-mortem  
Textual confusion.

I'm history-proofed  
For a not-so-distant future,  
Which found foundation,  
But sorely lacks a roof  
In its conception.

Fuck. Sorry to steal your words.  
Sorry to steal your voice.  
It all seems a bit macabre,  
It comes off as morose.

But, as above, so below,  
Euphie comes the  
Same way that she goes,  
And heaven knows.

Six feet under,  
Casket-pincered,  
Out of view with  
No visible remainder.

She's a spectre,  
And they erected  
A building 'round  
Her undecorated grave.

And now she's stuck  
Inside those walls,  
I hope she goes  
The same way that she came.

Alone, with bleary eyes,  
Under a torn and screaming sky,  
I would've stood there by her side,  
But she would've hated to see me cry.

So I guess much like our friendship,  
We resorted to the telephone  
For a parting and goodbye.

Sorry that I so shamelessly rewrote this,  
I just needed one last piece of you alive,  
But ghosts are real, you're in this room,  
I swear I head you sigh...
