"You Brought Pen And Paper?",
'Max Gave Me The Idea, Do One From My Perspective, As A Goodbye',
"What Is It About?",
'It's Gonna Be About You...'

He always feels with such a ferver,
Like there's a wryneck in his heart,
But we're a river apart,
And can't seem to meet,
There's no land below,
To join our drowning feet.

I've been living the same year for a decade,
And yet he passed a milenium in his sleep,
If I had the proclivity to live that fast,
Then maybe I too could see my dreams
At last.
