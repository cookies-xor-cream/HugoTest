Carmin Got Us Kicked Out The Bar And One Of Us, I'm Not Sure Who, Invited Me Over

Friend of a friend knew too many details about a place I met someone entirely different. Thought the two were the same without quite thinking through the cataclysmic implications of it all.

Evicted, redacted, got my deal struck and rescinded,
Talking, or crawling, either way she's 9n floor 4, hear it now calling,
You said "come in, be at home, pour yourself just one glass,
And then pour me two more, I need drinks,
You're exciting and I'm a fucking bore".

Maybe it's the bottle of whatever we're drinking,
I doubt that it's water, but I want now to test that,
So please hand me another.

This is where she lives, but you're living a guilt trip,
So we're stuck to your bedframe, where the rug slipped,
And painted the carpet red.
