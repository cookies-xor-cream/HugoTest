I dreamt that Cancer had its claws in you,  
that you were victim to a crab,  
and Ursa Minor tried in vain,  
to pry you from its greedy hands.

I dreamt that you were Andromeda,  
spent the weekend in the stars,  
all the constellations dots joined up,  
into stellar prison bars.

And come the day I sadly know,  
you'll sit on sunbeams in the sky,  
for your lunar cell won't let you go,  
but I wasn't ready to say goodbye.

I'd sooner die than judgment pass,  
on that pure and fragile heart,  
the penal code's not in your blood.  
it just isn't in the cards,

So when they weighed that weary pump,  
did it play its part and show its hand,  
by sprouting out its own two wings and  
playing out our masterplan?

I hope Osiris treats you well,  
and I've got Hades on my phone,  
so if the pantheon's preferred,  
please just call to let me know?

And if you find you're feeling lonely  
then I've got eight feet worth of rope,  
so call me if you're losing hope,  
come and haunt me if you're getting bored.
