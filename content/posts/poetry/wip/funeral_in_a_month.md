Don't go digging kid, there's nothing good to find or to unearth,  
I swear to god this line of thinking will see you six feet under-earth,  
I don't care what you might think that she has done to me,  
I just want my friend back here, can we please just be at peace?

Why is it so much harder for you to try to just forgive,  
Can't you bury weary hearts underneath your tattered sleeve?  
We only had that last month together, I would rather just forget,  
Fuck the overdramatics, live the joy that you deserve.
