Weather Weighing Down The Weeping Willow

She sat under the tree,  
on days where it rained,  
so it could teach her to cry,  
to channel her pain.

But the willow forgot,  
coz she's at miserypoint,  
that's the temperature where,  
tears preemptively boil.

So now the willow can't weep,  
it sleeps through the rain,  
it's catching its tears,  
and is going insane.

Please teach him to cry,  
he must be retaught,  
his roots are losing their grip,  
pent up in his thoughts.
