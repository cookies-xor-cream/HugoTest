A Friend's Miscarriage

She got a visit from a dying stork,
And in this game of cosmic chess,
They had caught us in a fork,
I gave up both queen and equs,
Got a ten buck champagne bottle,
And watched you pop the cork.
You've gone nine months without drinking,
I'd tell you that I was proud,
But it seems counter-productive
To say that shit out loud.
