Goldfish went to pick up the bottle,
But knows the aquatic can drown,
So in the intermission of twitching,
She finds herself putting it down.

Goldfish looks for the door,
But then lays down to snore,
For she forgets she can go,
And that this isn't her home.

Goldfish hate to remember,
And she loves to forget,
That this pond that we built's
The only water we get.

Now I'm caught between the two worst things,
A goldfish and monsters with dorsal fins,
I'd argue the former's in a league of its own,
For if you always forget, then you'll reap what history has sown.
