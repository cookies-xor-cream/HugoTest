There's a unity that's found  
Between euphoria and dysphoria,  
And it is found in depth.

Whether it's good or it's not,  
That which I feel, I will always,  
And forever feel in heft.

Whether a blessing or a curse,  
Whether set in stone or chiselled  
With a pasty chalk-tipped pen.

Whether an anchor or a float,  
I swear to god, this is theft,  
I'm wearing my heart off a dead wren.

But I'm no songbird,  
I am a mute with vodka,  
And a shitty ballpoint pen.
