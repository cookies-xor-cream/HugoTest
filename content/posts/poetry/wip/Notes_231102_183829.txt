Nesting In Your Captivity

Birds lay earthbound, cinched and pinned
In your aviary of flightless feathered strays
That you found and forcibly crammed in,
And now are roosting here to stay.

I feel like a vulture on your carcass,
Missing a migration eyeing down a corpse,
You're the North upon my compass,
I'm going to come break your repose.

I'm a member in a flock in a menagerie filled by your selections,
There's no place else I'd rather be than trapped in your avian collection.
