The Proof Is Too Large To Fit In The Margin's: My Last Theorem

It's been a happier week,
I'm lucky that life humbled me,
Without shattering my esteem,
Or at least that's how it seems.

Because sometimes I feel like
This reads like a novel suspended
In disbelief, but all the
Stories that I have, are rendered
Beyond recognition,
Such that they're paper thin.
Not to fit the page,
But line the margins and seams.
