Thanks for wiping the lunar umbra off my face, I wish you would tell me your name.

But for now (or forever?), your make-up removal service will have to suffice.

"Heads and you tell me your full name.
But tails will get unrestricted access to my face"

A relative-friend but total stranger,
Lended me her make-up remover.
She asked one too many questions,
About last night and the too-near future.

Each ask went without riposte,
Omission is the post I chose.
Her hands were in violent erasure,
But her dialogue was nowhere close.

So I fell in love with ampersands,
And commas where they shouldn't be.
I fell in love with my disjunctions,
At each conjunction's grave malfunction.

I have an answer on the line beneath,
But I'm afraid of the dependent clause.
There's a demon in slumber at the end,
At the terminus of this silent pause.

And I'm afraid that to tread him over,
Means that I will see his ire wake.
