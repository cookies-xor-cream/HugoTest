I still spot your dad's car once a seldom while when I'm walking out at night,
Do you recall the time spent with the winter wind chattering through your teeth,
Painting cracks on your sun-damaged pair of unused and heat-shattered rose red lips,
Your kiss didn't feel like anything at all, just lips on lips tethered in their heartless vacancies.

Do you remember when you told me that you loved me on the roundabout at my street,
I must have a thing for circular narratives, you know the story always goes,
We split to find a girl or boy, and when it eventually goes poorly we remeet.
