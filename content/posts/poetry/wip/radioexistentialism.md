If you sonographed my heart,  
There'd only be static on the screen,  
So i might as well stay in,  
And play with the channels on TV,  
(I would see the same god damn thing.)

If you sonographed my head,  
You'd get a moir√© inspired splash,  
Some physical phonemon,  
Indicating the polarity that I have.  
(Just unplug and watch the black on black)

Plugged into the probe,  
Pressed until it bleeds,  
Dig into the coronary  
Like it's not an empty cavity.

And then you would believe  
I'm comprised fully of my vacancies,  
I haven't got nothing except for nothing,  
Nothing is all that's left in me.

Someone swiped a magnet on my chest,  
My heart crashed but forgot to self-reset,  
And I'm scrambling for the power switch,  
It must've been left inside when I had the thing restitched.
