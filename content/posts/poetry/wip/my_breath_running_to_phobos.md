title: "My Breath, Running To Phobos"

My exhales ran receding,  
from the egress and the exit plan,  
for which they were desperately pleading,  
but never would have actually had.

I didn't grow these lungs,  
to let them sit, be sleeping idle,  
I own them to absorb the air,  
a permeable pressure-pumped divider.

Air, water, and earthy breath,  
I'll inhale things I never meant,  
for they'll clean out with my  
tracheal filter and exhale.

And now that panting's come to pass,  
this frame that holds your painting  
is destined still to stick and last,  
in a hazy spiralled abstract ending.

The past five minutes have been a dream,  
I don't know your name and don't want to,  
but I think that I'd be too fatigued,  
if I was to find another to fill in for you.

I asked your contact, said "only friends",  
to which you sighed and promptly said,  
"It may start that way but how'll it end?",  
so I told you "either with time or lead".

I'd picked up a spider on the climb,  
you asked me if I was an arachnophobe,  
I brushed it out my hair and said,  
tonight gave me courage to stay composed.

That Phobos couldn't make a dent,  
even with hell and heaven shifted,  
but then she asked who Phobos was,  
and the fault between our pairing rifted.
