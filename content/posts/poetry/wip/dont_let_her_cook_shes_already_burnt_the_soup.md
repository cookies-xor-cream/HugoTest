She's shallow, but she's fucking gorgeous,  
and she thinks that can bridge the difference,  
I almost asked her name like it wasn't a mistake,  
but that's a risk that I'm not willing to take.

I suppose it's shallow of me in turn  
to judgement pass on so little learned,  
but I'm a cauldron and can't help but churn  
long past since when the tonic's burnt.
