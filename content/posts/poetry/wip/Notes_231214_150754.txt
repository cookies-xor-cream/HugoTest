Saccade To The (Heart)beat

I want to take a metre, I need to take a beat,
I need find some level ground to plant my feet,
For I sprained my ankle when I bruised my heart,
I emptied my brain of blood, like a hard restart,
A reboot played as strategy for my retreat,
To forget the ferrum staining on my teeth.

The bow on your neckline is so misplaced,
It's pulling my gaze, it's prying off your face,
But if I had a dime for every glance that you caught,
I'd cash them in for side eye at the coffee shop 

You make my chest race, but I want a marathon,
To hold eye contact, not be slated on the wall,
I want to hear you ramble, to listen to every word,
Some abject terror you were worried would go unheard.

But I can't meet this inelastic overflowed demand,
There's too little supply of my two lone hands,
It's such a shame that I jitter at the slightest touch,
Some eldritch twitch that wires both our jaws.
