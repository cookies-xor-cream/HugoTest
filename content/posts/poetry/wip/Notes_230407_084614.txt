New Mystery Seeds (Can't Pick What Grows, But Something Will)

Lay out the tarot, I'm guiding this ship,  
I know we lost the captain and the rudder,  
but I don't need them, I'm in the stream.

I sometimes wish I had the same power,  
over the happenings found inside my head,  
but I will water this orchid flower,  
and I still will, long after its dead.
