New Mystery Seeds (Can't Pick What Grows, But Something Will)

Lay out the tarot, I'm guiding this ship,
I know we lost the captain and the rudder,
But I don't need them, I'm in the stream.

I sometimes wish I had the same power,
Over the happenings found inside my head,
But I love watering this orchid flower,
And I still will, long after its dead.
