A Taxonomy Of Pickup Lines, Transcribed By My Neighbour

"Are we spelled R,
Coz we could be a functional group"

"I hope that you stay context-free,
Because I want your only state to
Be being with me"

"I hope we're non-eulerian,
I want to cross this edge again"

"We can be two sinks of a Markov chain,
And a reduction away from being a single
Solution system"

"A trigram search would find some subset
Of you matched in my every thought,
Even your absence match the patterns"

"Every time I look up at you,
There's a hash collision,
And I don't mean to probe,
But can we chain at this index?"

"Just as R is dense in Q,
My head is dense with you"

"I want to define our limit"

"I know my only escape
Is to plead insanity"

"I hope that this is only my final maritime flight
In the same way the previous ones were"

"You're all the panache found
In a no-hit run, reliant upon
A mediocre card, to trump the
Corrupted heart"

"If I fell, I would've fallen twice tonight"

I asked you how that last one was a pickup line,
You slurred something vague about a
Cliffside and how I needed context.

I'd tell you to stay safe,
But I don't think that's in your blood.

You seem like you would rather
Be having all this fun.

I just hope neither of you two wake up
And feel like you made a mistake.

Because I feel like you both did.

Kindest Regards,
Your Dearest 'Neighbour'
