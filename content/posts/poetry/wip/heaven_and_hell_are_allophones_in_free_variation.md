When I'm done, where do I go?  
Is there anything up higher,  
Or am I bound to journey below?  
I don't think I really want to know,  
I'm happy not living with vertigo.

But if as above so below, I know  
That I want to be buried in a hole,  
Somewhere deep, so trenched in snow,  
In wait for springtime cherry groves.

I hope the cherry trees cut me up,  
Splice me with their roots.

I'm the sowing of an autumn harvest,  
That's tread lightly underfoot.

I'm a forest by the highway rotting,  
Under a thin blanket of soot hiding.
