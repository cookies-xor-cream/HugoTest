Today Is A Gateway Drug To Tomorrow

There is no sin, however grim,  
that could ever eclipse or underpin  
the purity of concentrated joy,  
that punctuates the sun setting at day's close.

There is no crime, however wrong,  
that could have me shaken forever long,  
tomorrow morning's a relapse of yesterday,  
a second chance to stitch the seams we frayed.

The sunset, and the sunrise hung around,  
like nothing if not a gateway drug,  
I'll live to see them both tomorrow,  
to steep my debt with the time I'll borrow.
