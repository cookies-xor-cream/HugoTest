This Isn't The Wrong Tower, But Even If It Was, I Would Never Leave Once You Showed Me The View

You can see the whole city from the hill,
I'm so happy for the decade I survived,
I finally feel like I'm at home somewhere,
Never felt so much like I'd arrived.

I love every place in every park,
I love all the b√©ton by every street,
I love everywhere the brightness bleeds,
And every crevice it can't reach.

Single stray headlights cross the bridges,
Like flickers of the people, like signs of life,
Stuck inside the light pollution,
In which the stars desperately try not to dive.

I think the sickness loosened my airways,
And I finally managed to cough it up,
Used to want to be anywhere but here,
But I suppose that I had had enough.

The asphalt shone like yellow bricks,
Juxtaposed by moonlight aqua,
Riverside as the grass debated,
A shade between its green and fuschia.

I don't need the stars, I have the city,
We'll save on pepper and salt above,
I feel so much for the starry sky,
But the streetlights and the people
Are my first and truest love.
