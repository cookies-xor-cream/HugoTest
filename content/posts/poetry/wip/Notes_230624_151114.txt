Starless Nyxkin: Even The Dimmest Still Phospheresce

"If I razed the forest to find you, though you don't shine, you'd eclipse that spectacle of a lightshow"

I saw the treeline swallow your cellphone light,
A star denied its shining by the branches.
Retracted from a burning thing,
Turning promptly back to ashes.

Life's got you tangled up, ensnared,
In a capillary killing's offshoots,
Illuminating betwixt the tendrils
Of the plants that take their roots.

You caught fire on my palmside skin,
Stayed as embers to blacken on my hands,
You're the forest's request for a phosphene touch,
For it'd rather burn than stand.

"I really wish it was next week instead of in half a decade, that would vacate from our decisions any future heartbreak.

But I'm young enough and far enough removed from death to still have cinders remaining from my faith"
