Paroxysms of wrath strung out,  
In their peroxide and amide burnings,  
As a triple of sarin witches over  
On the cauldron, were stuck digesting, churning.

But tell me if there's any left  
Should I drink an LD100's worth?  
Coz a sliver's chance to survive  
Would hold my hand throughout tonight.

I've got second thoughts,  
And remorse to boot,  
And cold feet like stalactites stuck to the ground  
That are waiting to be shattered underfoot.

The best of me,  
It wants to call  
The worst of her,  
To explain it all.

But I know the more I say,  
You more you tell me to  
Abandon these runic ways.

I know the more that I recount,  
The more you tell me to turn around  
And head back to my home tonight.

And I'll do exactly that,  
I've got fantasies strung in my head,  
But not a single is a healthy one,  
That I require to enact.

So take the missed calls,  
And misty-eyed voice memos  
That I have left,  
With a mountain made of rocky salts,  
Like snow upon the summit,  
Displaced and waiting for these  
Chemicals to fizzle out,  
And leave you be at peace.

Let me leave you be at peace,  
It's my last will and testament,  
A request made in a lament,  
As much as I might detest  
The silence.

This is the path of least resistance,  
Of minimum bloodshed and nonviolence.
