I Walked Into A Spider Web Tonight

My breathing stopped,
My heart kept rhythm,
A metronome clocking out,
Barely able to slither.

It snaked from side to side,
I counted every tick,
I had a few more left,
Before I'd get sick.

So in turn it stopped,
To leave a beat as slack,
Petrification in place,
Of the bravery that I boldly lacked.
