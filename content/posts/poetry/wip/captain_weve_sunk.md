I thought you were shelter for this troubled weather but you're only shelter like a hurricane is shelter for its rubble. Every word is wronger than the last.

So captain, batten down the hatches if you'd please, it looks like we're going down real fast.

A demon on your shoulder wearing verdant plume now strums syllables from its larynx, not it's brain. Who knew that the lack thereof semantics could still harbour so much pain?
