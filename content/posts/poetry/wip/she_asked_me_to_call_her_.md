Mazlow's pyramid is crowned with dread,  
the final trap's the self and its silhouette,  
for it takes a fool to want to climb,  
when only sycophants ascend.

And what she said at the clinic stuck,  
left me wading through the mud:  
she said penance is paid with knowledge,  
and only vengeance begs for blood hands upon it.

It's hard to live angry.  
I don't think that  
I've got any of this  
violence still left in me.

Coronate me,  
and my decree  
will be that we  
must never speak.

But my gorgeous fool,  
my dearest jester,  
with so much time removed,  
why do you hold onto her?

I'm so fucking sick of  
nightly haunts and bedroom ghosts,  
maybe if you lighten up,  
they'll remember how to float away?

From ash to ash,  
and dust to dust,  
we're just passing matter  
from star to dying star.

From blood to blood,  
we're born the same,  
there's living proof,  
just not in our names.

But I'll still call you 'sister',  
if that will keep you sane.  
I'll keep playing,  
this sorry and this stupid fucking game.
