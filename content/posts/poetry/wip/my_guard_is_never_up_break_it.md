I climbed in bed, I loved to be sat face to face. But not to touch, and not to see. There's just something lovely about the concept of her company. It makes me want to always keep her exactly one half metre away from me.

Unless, I guess, she offers me a drink. Then I would have another think about the boundary I've set: that she may never inch a pace towards or away from me. But if it comes to that we'll see, if she'd really like to use the key.
