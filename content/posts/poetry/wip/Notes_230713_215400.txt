Are Crows Not Pescatarian?

She thinks fucking the grieving 20-something  
while he's drunk is a bit of a bad look,  
I offered her a straight line to a goal,  
turns out that she doesn't move so much like a rook

The bird, and not the chess-piece, for it can go  
as the crow flies, high above, not chained below,  
Like me honey, I'm not here, I'm a dead fish in the flow,  
so make like a corvid, please get off your high horse  
and swoop low.
