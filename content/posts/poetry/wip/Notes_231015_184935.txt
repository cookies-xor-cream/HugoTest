"You Ever Had McDonald's On A Swingset, Arya? It's On My Bucket List..."

I didn't expect that you'd say right now when I asked when you'd be free,
Suggesting dinner on a swingset sounds not like you, and more like a feverdream,
I know it was only a half hour spent briefly with cheap food in a dingy park,
But thank you, I think that you really made my night.
