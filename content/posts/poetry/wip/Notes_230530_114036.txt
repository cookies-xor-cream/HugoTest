Autoarson For Chemical Potential
Not For Abundance Of Temperature, But For Revival As Fuel

Gracious indignation,  
Came as hellish immolation,  
Turned me into a pyre,  
A hobbled hostess of this fire.

For I only have my anima,  
In the form of frenzied mania,  
For I had lost my animus,  
In the molting of my husk.  
Lost it inside disgrace  
That I never could've faced,  
Or put aside.

Alude, elide,  
Separate.  
Fissure the fixture  
Found inside.

But if I can't fly  
And I can't glide  
What have I remnant  
Of the sky still to find?

What ceiling blues could  
Ever hide from me and you?
