"It's like you're addicted to contact transmission,  
and everyone you touch feels a paroxysm of remission",  
*"The outbreak of a sudden wellness,*  
*like the root disease still can fester".*

"All who brush you lose their essence",  
*"I'm not The Collector, it's just my presence",*  
"Sounds like words not spoken by The Collected",  
*"If I've collected you, divine me, please, how you are afflicted?".*

"I used to think, have original thought,  
but the idea of you had my stores bought dry",  
*"I never asked for obsession, never planned on it,*  
*this trial is judgement passed by your own hand,*  
*so own it and*  
*reflect on where we stand".*
