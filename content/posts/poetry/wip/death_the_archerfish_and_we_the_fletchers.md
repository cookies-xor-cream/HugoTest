If death took form  
As an archerfish  
Then I would be  
Its fletcher.

If love took form  
As an archerfish  
He would miss you  
Instead of me.

Cleanse my heart,  
Let me my ease,  
Lighten this heavy  
Burden off of me.

Find me not so singly directed,  
But pointed with my little purpose,  
Sans agency, just barely light enough  
To fall causal to an autumn breeze.
