You put your chin on my shoulder,  
Said that you liked my panache,  
Sweetheart, you are on fire,  
You're gonna burn us down into ash.

You said you liked my inscriptions,  
Asked me to tell you what they say,  
I suggested I give you a reading,  
Recite scripture in a quiet cozy place.

You bought us an ocean of whiskey,  
Matched me with a shot for a shot,  
Said that I would lose, go down,  
That drink can't have you drowned.

Then you receded, quickly postured away,  
Said that your boy couldn't make it out here today,  
I asked why approach me, you gave me a hug,  
Said you were so sorry, just got caught up in passing the time.

I asked why so receptive,  
And so you gave me a tale,  
Said that you're defenceless  
When wit comes your way.

But, I don't have any wit,  
I'm at my wit's end with you,  
If the only requisite's to heckle  
You'd flirt with half of the room.
