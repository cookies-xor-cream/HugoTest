title: "Unplugging Is Gonna Hurt This Time, Isn't It?"

The moonlight absconding strung scarce and receding,  
Ensnared in the valence between our ring fingers.  
So I saw the gleam scuttle, just to sputter then die,  
Wish we redacted this glimmer with some shadows of mine.

So I suggested to you that the gaps in your hands  
Would fit so neatly in mine by request or demand,  
The response flickered in courage like an old bedside lamp  
But you mustered the connection to plug into my hands.

And as we sat in the park with the moon at our side,  
Afloat in the sky, protesting passage of time,  
From now till forever, it has chosen to stay,  
And I pray to the sun that my lamp does the same.
