Greek Fire, Napalm, And The Failure To Extinguish

"At least it doesn't stick like napalm",
I eyed her down, waiting on the correction,
"Sorry, let me a second attempt,
I forgot I was talking to the napalm magnet".

A planet made from ocean foam,
Hit the ground, and undid her cuffs,
Only to have found herself,
Entirely free to roam the hallowed crust.

---

She was borne of the ocean in a vehement surging torrent,
She escaped from the flow in the ebb of a slowly dying current,
She overstayed the sea god's welcome,
Stayed for millennia that he can't annul.

And with Venus arrived, she sits mocking thoroughly,
Dousing me in gasoline, and lighting up the hurry stuck inside of me.

Tell your brothers, tell your sisters, you're just ships sailing into the night,
But I'm neither lighthouse, nor a cod, for the sea god's starving bite.

And though lifeless extracted from the water,
The closer that you get,
The more that you can hear,
The saline eat my skin like acid tears.

And though brightly lit as I might seem,
The closer that you get,
The more that you can hear,
Of my immolated screams and silent fear.
