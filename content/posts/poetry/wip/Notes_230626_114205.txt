She was sitting at the riverbank,  
On a grassy patch by the tejo,  
Watching the Lisbon crowd,  
Come and quickly go.

I can picture her sitting,  
Catching every beam,  
Drowned in moonlight as it  
Illuminates that stream.

Her reflection's looking back,  
With empty faded eyes  
Hannah flew back up to Britain,  
But London? Didn't know it was time.
