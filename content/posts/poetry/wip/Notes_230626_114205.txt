She was sitting at the riverbank,
On a grassy patch by the tejo,
Watching the Lisbon crowd,
Come and quickly go.

I can picture her sitting,
Catching every beam,
Of moonlight that
Illuminates that stream.

Her reflection's looking back,
With those faded empty eyes
Hannah flew back up to Britain,
But London?
