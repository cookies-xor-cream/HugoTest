Your Sling Reminded Me Of When They Broke Their Arm

The terse curse of  
All this rising tension  
Seeks release by means of  
Self-inflicted violence.

---

The ticking of the second hand  
Accumulates in my ulnar column,  
I need some manual contortion  
To take the pressure off it.

The boy behind me heard a  
Week's worth of the snap release,  
And it freaked him out: you could  
See his eyes holding his unease.

So we walked the next five talking,  
He gave me insight to remorse,  
Paralleled the crackle to  
His infinite stockpile of morose.

I helped him tie his shoes,  
As his arm caught in a sling,  
I felt as if I was a jester,  
Performing for my king.

I didn't use my name,  
And I never asked for his.  
Please, no expansion of the cast,  
I only need some peace.

"Hey, you talk to strangers often?"  
*"Every second I'm alone, how come?"*  
"You... seem practiced, I dunno..."
