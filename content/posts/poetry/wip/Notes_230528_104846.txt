Your Sling Reminded Me Of When They Broke Their Arm

The terse curse of  
all this rising tension  
seeks release by means of  
self-inflicted violence.

---

The ticking of the second hand  
accumulates in my ulnar column,  
I need some manual contortion  
to take the pressure off it.

The boy behind me heard a  
week's worth of the snap release,  
and it freaked him out: you could  
see his eyes holding his unease.

So we walked the next five talking,  
he gave me insight to remorse,  
paralleled the crackle to  
his infinite stockpile of morose.

I helped him tie his shoes,  
as his arm caught in a sling,  
I felt as if I was a jester,  
performing for my king.

I didn't use my name,  
and I never asked for his.  
please, no expansion of the cast,  
I only need some peace.

"Hey, you talk to strangers often?"  
*"Every second I'm alone, how come?"*  
"You... seem practiced, I dunno..."
