A Butcher Where A Surgeon Should Be

I needed clean cuts, but you're blindfolded with a knife,
And you've hacked at bone too much yet somehow the flesh isn't even sliced.

Your ulna is blossoming a bruise-addled purple,
Caught in a burst and decay of information you dismember and then splay.

I don't think your grip can hold tight onto my words,
I hate that you never listen, how every word is only technically heard.
