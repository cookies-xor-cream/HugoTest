Phonetic realisations are reimagined as impediments of a half-hearted speech.  
They're found in lisping awkward stuttering things that your tongue has gifted me,  
I called it slurring but you like to think of it as the grand renaissance of sonic liaison,  
I could hear it in your speaking but you unsuccessfully tried to assure me:  
Said you were sober with the vocab from a bad stretch of 19th century writing,  
Using contractions of 'betwixt' picked up from your hopeless friend and his endless whining.
