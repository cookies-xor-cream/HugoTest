Sometimes Mirrors Are The Scariest Things

At my dexterior lay my sinister chirality,
A clockwise spiral to a stereoscopic duality,
She's mirror-trapped echo, smithed in memory foam,
An amnesiac revenant that started to roam.

You can dream when I can't, so I'll write you a script,
And leave you pheremone trails to trail down to her crypt,
She found her self stuck in remission, but not the disease,
So fantasise in her place if you would so please.

You're the pump of the heart that she tried to restart,
And I've been counting the cards, but I'm not planning to stop 
Whichever way you might cut it, we're the same a decade apart,
Sweetheart, I hope reading my eulogy fucking tears you apart.
