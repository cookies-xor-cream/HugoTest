Mirrors Are The Scariest Things

At my dexterior lay my sinister chirality,  
a clockwise spiral to a stereoscopic duality,  
she's mirror-trapped echo, smithed in memory foam,  
an amnesiac revenant that's forgotten to roam.

You can dream when I can't, so I'll write you a script,  
and leave you pheromone trails to trail down to her crypt,  
she found herself stuck in remission, but not the disease,  
so fantasize in her place if you would so please.

You're the pump of the heart that she tried to restart,  
and I've been counting the cards, I'm not planning to stop   
whichever way you might cut it, we're the same a decade apart,  
sweetheart, I hope reading my eulogy fucking tears you apart.
