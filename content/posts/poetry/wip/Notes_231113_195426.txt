Levo Where Levo Shouldn't Be

This head of mine is seretonergically challenged,  
Despite all the evidence, I can still feel insecure,  
Only some self-belief or annealing can spin this fucking feeling 'round,  
But seeing isn't believing, so what the fuck are mirrors even for?  
What is her sister even on about anymore?  
Call me 'levo' the way I'm no longer enantiomerically pure.
