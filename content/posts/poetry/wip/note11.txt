An Open Letter To Nobody At All

This book is living rent free in my head.
I think this picture is an exemplar of the night. 
They made me feel nothing but you were in love with all the lights.
You broke my rule about no pictures, but I think that that's alright?

So Ms Shaky Hands And Blurry Eyes,
Thank you for my Thursday night.
