Hydrogen And Ethanol (In Vacuum)

I got my dream date in a cemetery, like a cut and paste from my fantasies. And somehow we spent half of it talking about the syllabus of highschool ATAR chemistry.

I need today on paper, but my black pen's dry, my writing's pink on pink like litmus into acid or your jacket on your shirt. Or the caustic acrid flower-bed in catalysis on the dirt.

We're lighter than the lightest noble gas, but less inert. I pray this passion will never come to pass, but know that it is destined for an end, ethylhydroxide-bound, however long deferred.

And when we're found entwined in a pairing that is s2 hybridised, there is an upwards draft of air. Tell me that you can also feel the heat from the eating of the steel and ferrous things.

For as we rise up through the sky, I can feel our full ascent begrudgingly married to the decreasing less than a single atmosphere of thinned-out air we found all the way up here.

I can see it in your eyes: we are the failure of a contradicting passing of a poptest, for we found the burning fasting. We're redacting Hindenberg, but know at last this flame could never be contained.

That given breath, we will go pop.
Like we're a ticking timebomb, or a quickly dying clock.
Someday soon, or maybe late, we're upwards bound, to immolate.
Play crack the sky, a curtain call to blind our eyes and pierce our ears.
I wonder if the drums on them can hear our fate unwinding from down here.

So tell me dear, if you had sights set on the sky, would you bring popcorn and a splint to watch this Hindenberg flare out the darkness from tonight?

Although technically, I suppose, the break of dusk in the graveyard is all that we foretold. The models of our chemistry have really got away from me,
Stating that togetherness is based on a proclivity for mutual reciprocated reactivity.
We're explaining things we shouldn't do, like this chemical clock that's comprised from me and you.
