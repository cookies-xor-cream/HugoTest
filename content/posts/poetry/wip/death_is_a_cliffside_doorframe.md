If I lock it,
she can just walk around...

My morning's a trilogy's rewrite, coz I'm waking up thrice,  
for each time that I sleep, like that is the price,  
for shedding this curse, I'm at war with my wrists,  
coz I'm writing down lists of the things that you'd miss.

I'm half a novel in deep, and it's getting real bleak,  
but the fall isn't steep, and the door doesn't creak,  
so take your passage at ease, you're not in love with a ghost,  
it takes life in a corpse to be chasing repose.

I know I should go with the ebb and the calm,  
but the flow of this red that falls at my feet,  
it's begging me no, and you know how I feel,  
why'd they cancelled the show? At least you found peace.

I hope that you found comfort in the highlight reel.
