The Sender's Address Was A Recently Empty Apartment

You cried quietly cradling that package in your chest,
I asked you to open it besides me to read the letter,
I want to know what in the fuck that thing could say,
And why she wrote that it wasn't destined for my gaze.

And then you ruined it with a tone deaf comment about someone that I probably could have loved,
(If only she wasn't fucking sick, if only she could've fucking lived, didn't have to fucking go and die),
And I'd be at your throat right then but the whiskey's way too strong, doubt that I could kill you if I tried.
