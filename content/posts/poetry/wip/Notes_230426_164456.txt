Sunspots scrolling across half-closed eyelids,
From speedbump highbeams that I can't rid,
I've got a migraine clawing at the front,
Of the inside of my face with all its blight.

Ill entertain your pestilence,
And the remnants of half-hearted insolence,
Just know if I crash with this velocity,
I'll free the spirit and the essence inside of me.

Heaven, hell, or purgatory, wherever I might find,
I'll finally find myself free.
