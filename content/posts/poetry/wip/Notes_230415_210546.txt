You never felt for the words that fall off the page,
Only for the self that printed on paper,
With the pestilence of the penance of every missed wage,
That you need so dearly to prop up this stage.

Life is an act, so read me the lines,
It's a stalemate in history,
A predestination of a tie,
That we both spent in recovery.

The drink on the shelf on the blurb of a book,
Is a projection of a coaster, warped in the aspect,
By the magnitude of the drinks that we took,
Make a reason to leave, search for your bed,
I've got a hair trigger, but the potential fracture is hinting a sect.
