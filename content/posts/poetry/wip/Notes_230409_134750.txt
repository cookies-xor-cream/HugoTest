Headache Debt: Didn't Have Enough To Make The Down Payment

I opted to drink a little ahead of time,
An effort to keep the headache at bay,
I got one anyways, and the drinking only
Got in the way,
Of my droning through the buckets of pain.

I finished the remainder of the bottle,
And put a cup-sized dent in the new one,
Turns out forgetting not to take your pills,
And mixing them with vodka is extremely fun.
