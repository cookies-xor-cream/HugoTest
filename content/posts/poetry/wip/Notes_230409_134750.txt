Headache Debt: Didn't Have Enough To Make The Down Payment

I opted to drink a little ahead of time,  
an effort to keep the headache at bay,  
I got one anyways, and the drinking only  
got in the way,  
of my droning through the buckets of pain.

I finished the remainder of the bottle,  
and put a cup-sized dent in the new one,  
turns out forgetting not to take your pills,  
and mixing them with vodka is extremely fun.
