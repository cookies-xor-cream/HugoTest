ParÄ«sa Liked My Hair

I don't need it to be quick,
Only I'd WANT it to be fast,
But with the force that you are using,
You're gonna make these tremors last

I told her to be gentler,
But she crept up to my face,
Tightened the belts and buckles,
Fastening me in place.

Now a decades passed,
And at the time,
I never thought
I'd get a haircut that I liked.

But I haven't yet
Got a nightmare
Of the latest one.
