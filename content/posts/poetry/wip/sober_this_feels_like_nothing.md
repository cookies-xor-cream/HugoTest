I had a run-in on the 950 west,  
I'm almost inclined to call her a friend,  
But she spent a solid 5 fucking minutes,  
Convincing me that I'm depressed.

My mental state's unravelling,  
Please stop pulling at the threads,  
I'd roll the loose strings into a ball,  
But it seems we're short all three fates on-call.

She walked me to the library,  
And told me that I seemed scared,  
I told her that this place was mine,  
And it's something I can't want to share.

She seemed to understand the sentiment.  
Said that she'd be getting out my hair.  
She asked me for my schedule so that  
She could guarantee keeping out my way.

And at the notion of a last goodbye,  
She said that we've probably gone  
And done this at least six or seven times.

So she took my arm, and whisked me back,  
Retracing steps to a lonely patch of grass,  
That holds no weighting on our common past.

She said she wanted to mark this time,  
And fixed my collar, then my hair,  
And though the air around her's mango,  
She tastes undoubtedly like lime or lemon zest.

I remember you asked me on a call,  
Around T-1week, or sometime then,  
How a kiss could be platonic,  
Solely sentiment exchanged by friends.

If you're watching me from somewhere now,  
Then I suppose you have the evidence  
That it can be.  
And all the justification as to how.

It was something other, something else,  
Whatever could the difference make?  
A single tinkered or doctored drink,  
Is less than what it could or will ever take.
