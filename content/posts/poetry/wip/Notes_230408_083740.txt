No Reason Not To Isn't An Argument For Anything

There's an ammendment to the addendum,
And I've got the lemma and the premise,
I know the proof is somewhere here,
I just gotta find out exactly where it is.

When I answered her "no",
She joked that "first time's the charm",
That soon she'll up and she'll go,
And so "where is the harm?"

I told her she's wrong,
And the lack of the bad,
Isn't a proof that we're
On the right path.
