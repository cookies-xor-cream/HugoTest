Solar Storm

After the dryest day came flooded night
I was exalted in her highbeam's lights,
In awe of heaven's flaring suntruck eyes,
Dimmer than those up on the driver's side.

Her solar gaze stormed to split the rain,
To shelter and absolve me of my pain,
But as the weather flared out either way,
I realised all that's left to do was pray.

You're like a blackhole for my memories,
When I'm with you history can't follow me,
I'm drawn to you, but lack the gravity,
And so it's *you* who has to summon *me*.
