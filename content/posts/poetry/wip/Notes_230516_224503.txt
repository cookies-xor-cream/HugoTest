What Is "Car" Short For If Not Carmen

I got ice in a bottle,
Like a snowstorm tamed,
I trapped it in place,
And I gave it a name.

I should have asked for your name,
But I guess I missed the chance,
From context, I think inknow your mum?
But I guess come next Tuesday,
The wondering will come to pass,
Or I'll stay not knowing, for forever at last.
