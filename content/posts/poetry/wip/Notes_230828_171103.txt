Every Tuesday A Chicken In Me (Boneless)

If you're really that which you eat,
I suppose that I am spineless,
But bones couldn't be so vital,
And so I guess I must digress.

A tangent line regarding chicken,
And asymptotic Tuesdays where
I order the same boneless wings,
That I re-rehearsed just the other week.

If I had the heart, and bore the soul,
I could maybe brave the in-tact corpse,
Realise that dinner's not eaten for
A perpetual avoidance of the bones.

Now every Tuesday (approximately),
A spineless chicken is finding me,
All my friends are osteovorous,
But that doesn't apply to me I guess.

Maybe next Tuesday...
I mean,tomorrow, actually,
I'll find some calcite shards inside
Of the post-extinction dinosaur.

Mineral sticks inside of the
Chicken I stick inside of me.
