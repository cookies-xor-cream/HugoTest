It's easier to reach the other side than it is to reach some people on this side; may as well pretend they're dead?

I'd really like a diagnostic
for what's cutting our time short,
one last speedy discourse,
one final quick retort.

I don't think that I'm a medium,
so I'll hold a s√©ance in reverse,
let me possess the ghost,
I'll inherit you that curse.

I'm writing on a mirror,
and it isn't even fogged,
but it holds all of the timesheets,
that I never will have logged.
