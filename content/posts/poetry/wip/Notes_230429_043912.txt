It's easier to reach the other side than it is to reach some people on this side; may as well pretend they're dead?

Eugh, que será será

I'd really like a diagnostic
For what's cutting our time short,
One last speedy discourse,
One final quick retort.

I don't think that I'm a medium,
So I'll hold a séance in reverse,
Let me possess the ghost,
I'll inherit you that curse.

I'm writing on a mirror,
And it isn't even fogged,
But it holds all of the timsheets,
That I never will have logged.
