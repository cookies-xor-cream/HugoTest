I need an obol for the boatman,  
If I want my hands in your hair,  
Can my send-off be the payment,  
Or would Charon double the fare?

I don't want to make you live,  
And I hate to watch you suffer,  
But oh my god, each reminder,  
Makes me want to strike an offer.

To you, to Charon,  
To the devil, or to Faust.  
To the God of the dead,  
Or his winter-struck spouse.

But I think that I would do so poorly  
In half-hearted attempts at losing barters,  
Charon's a fixed-rate kind of zombie,  
When it comes to his transtygian charter.

Anyone who won't consider  
This infraction in exchange,  
Of the pawn-obol of me,  
Can't comprehend the  
Remainders of change.
