He said he wanted closure,  
and all his questions answered,  
but really he wanted butterflies and honey,  
but the saccharides only bring bodyflies,  
and he's festering a corpse.

He scrambled through the pages,  
dismissing the heavy drizzle-drainage,  
and all the rest of the liquid damage,  
he went to speak but every word he squeezed out  
I sniped out of flight with my steely gaze.

I want to help him but I'm too far removed,  
Hannah was never here, and Amber has since moved,  
I'm all that he has left but he's searching for a ghost,  
but it's been too long, and I have found repose.

Pack your things, pick your clothes,  
you're stuck guarding an empty post,  
we're abandoned at this dinner party,  
by the memory of the cadaver of the host.
