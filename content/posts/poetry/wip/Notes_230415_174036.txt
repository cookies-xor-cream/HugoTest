I lost three layers of clothes in the crash and thought that apart from a change and a shower (and a temporary lapse in my eyesight) I came out unscathed

It turns out I perforated half of me and didn't find out till that shit finally left a scar on me a full 3 years later

Zoned Out Crossing, But Got Pulled Out Before The Uncoming Traffic Was No Longer Uncoming

I've got a souvenier for the litres I lost,
An inch for a metre in the carpark I crossed,
I was not in the car so you gave me the way,
You stopped but I left at mile a minute, just skidding away.
