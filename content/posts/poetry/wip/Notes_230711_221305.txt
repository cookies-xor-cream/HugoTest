The Medium's Finest Print

Vulpine thing, where have you been,
Sunder me from this accursed week, 
Brand me with the scarlet sharpie,
With an insignia of the meek.

No one holds a candle to the passage, 
But we can go to heaven, plant an adder,
Watch the serpent's poison bite,
Knock a rung or two off their ladder.

Okay. Fly safe, or don't, not like I'll ever know.

This was a lovely thought experiment. If you're ever lonely, I'd love to think it all through again.
