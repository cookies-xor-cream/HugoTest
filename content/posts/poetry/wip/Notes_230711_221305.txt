The Medium's Finest Jacket

Vulpine thing, where have you been,
Sunder me from this accursed week, 
Brand me using a poking iron,
With an insignia of the meek.

No one holds a candle to the passage, 
But we can go to heaven, plant an adder,
Watch the serpent's poison bite,
Knock a rung or two off this ladder's height.
