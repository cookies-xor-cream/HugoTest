The Sharpest Lives And Bluntest Funerals

My veins are hollow blood-fueled chains,
That hold my heart shackled in its place,
But she's got arrows and pointy things,
Ammunition to put my vitals back to sleep.

I wouldn't mind if you taxed my bloodwork,
If it meant you could finally set me free,
So stock up on your ammunition,
Let me be the start to your killing spree.

The difference between me and your corpse
Is that your revenant has no use for its bones,
Despite your skeleton you're always lame,
Ablast, aghast, and abattered in the quiet subterrain.
