I can almost hear you yell at me as I make a bad impression of a hobble teetered on my heels.  
I can't walk so straight quite yet, so call me back or leave me mail, I need one more last regret.  
I know that I am chasing lives in a history we have buried, but I've got diaries that we can fill with stories yet,  
We'll wager whiskey, find some cards and play a set, I'll cook the books so come here, place a bet, we've yet to start.

I had a dream you were in Perth and I could scarcely hold you back. I was anxious, I was trembling,  
I was shaking in these spasms to join hand in tired hand, until we did at last.  
This year I've spent sans you, it has only been just barely lived at best, well,  
At least I had some consolation in a culling of the worst, and I'm sans what I detest.

But I want the marker that you're here to be crystal in its clarity,  
I swear the city lights go out every flight you take away from me.

I won't give you one more measure,  
I won't give you those two beats I owe,  
I deferred them till the end, but oh well,  
We both know how that always tends to go.

Is the end etched in a softer thing than stone?  
Or is it however hard that your eyes can hold onto?  
Here's my ultimate suggestion: I'll meet you at the airport,  
You can call the tablet marrow, and I will call it bone.

An anacrusis scribed in brick and flesh,  
It's far too structurally sound to tear,  
The stresses like a limping, start on omnipresent downbeats,  
I've got one line to expend, but haven't any heartbeat left.

If that stanza had a chance, it would tear you clean apart,  
So, gorgeous, just know, it's not a rebuttal for my lack thereof a heart,  
But simply proof of improficiency, a display that I'm of average luck,  
Victim to the circumstance of a shitty hand of cards.

You had to move, didn't you?  
You had to move when you did, didn't you?  
Stupid me. I feel the right thing at all the wrong times.

Anyhow, my friend is visiting and sometimes I wonder if ever you two pass each other in Melbourne.
