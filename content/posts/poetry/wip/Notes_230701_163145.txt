Death Is A Cliffside Doorframe But If I Lock It, You Can Just Walk Around Anyways

My morning's a trilogy's rewrite, coz I'm waking up thrice,
For each time that I sleep, like that is the price,
For shedding this curse, I'm at war with my wrists,
Coz I'm writing down lists of the things that you'd miss.

I'm half a novel in deep, and it's getting real bleak,
But the fall isn't steep, and the door doesn't creak,
So take your passage at ease, you're not in love with a ghost,
It takes life in a corpse to be chasing repose.

I know I should go with the ebb and the calm,
But the flow of this red that falls at my feet,
It's begging me no, and you know how I feel,
Why'd they cancelled the show? At least you found peace.

I hope that you found comfort in the highlight reel.
