My Frontal Lobe Is Made Up Of Protons And Positrons

I saw a CRT TV, waiting patient in the bin,
please point it at my pupils, and cast the ray straight into it,
there's something in my head, I never could get out,
let's give a shot at a lobotomy,
that's a regret that I would live down,
or, at least it's worth a try?
