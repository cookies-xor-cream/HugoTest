What kind of person does it take,
to bury scars, to mark blank slates?
What kind of monster does one make,
when death is thread within their fate?

What kind of gore's there to be seen,
if you could only scarcely scream?
Does muting uncurl these torrid sight
Does silence cleanse blood from off your eyes?

What kind of hearing does one have,
if one can listen, but not speak it back?
And what kind of tongue is in a mouth,
if one can speak, but not listen up?

What kind of freedom is entailed,
if one must use it as prescribed?
what kind of virtue is there found,
when half truths are in essence lies.

What kind of truth is honesty?
What kind of lies comprise deceit?
If you require response from me,
then maybe you should just concede?
