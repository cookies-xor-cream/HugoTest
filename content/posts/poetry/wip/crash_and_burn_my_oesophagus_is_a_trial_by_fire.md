title: 'Crash And Burn: My Oesophagus Is A Trial By Fire'
date: 2024-02-26

I'm on the bathroom floor at work,  
Composing some stupid rhapsody,  
Made up of bouts of blasphemy,  
And hate for this neuropathic atrophy.

Neuroticism mixed with sharp nerve pains,  
Has displaced the contents of my stomach,  
And it arranged them out into a bowl,  
And rearranged me into a fucking wreck.

I've thrown up twice this morning,  
And think I'm done until tomorrow,  
The burning of the ejection's proof  
My stomach acid must be borrowed.

Maybe stolen away from a live volcano,  
We tapped the landmark of its excess,  
Some run-off pyroclastic flow,  
For a hydrochloric pH one egress.

I'm a denizen of these ceramic tiles,  
Ad infinitum, till forever comes to pass,  
I'd trade a bullet for a swift departure,  
I've got the burn, now I'm looking for a crash.
