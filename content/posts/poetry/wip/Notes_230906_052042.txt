If My Life Was A Movie It Would Be A 90 Minute Bout Of TV Static

Stephanie, had I your remote,
I'd turn off this stupid show.
I can't watch you staring at
This motion picture made of snow.

I am noise that albanesces,
Into a shitty, grainy, static film,
Like confused moir√© interference
Streaming across a TV screen.

I'm a pop up prompt in the bottom left,
That you're not on the right frequency,
I'm sure there's a more fitting program,
Maybe change the channel and we'll see?

I took a different path tonight.
I avoided the park.
I don't think seeing me is good for you.
It's not because we aren't friends,
It's because we are only that.

Have a nice life,
Get better friends.
