Doing Her Writing Assignments For Her So She'd Be Freer To Tell Me About Her Day (But Really The Reason I Wrote Them Is That My Real Love Was Words And That Which Was Made From Them)

My corpus of text is an extension of my 'self', or rather who I used to be,
I write so much worse than I used to do when I was only just fourteen,
But it still means the same amount, it's still the only thing that lightens me.

I remember you were so fucking frustrated to get a composition for your very first LIT class assignment.

I kind of wanted to do something other than watch you fumble with the page so I put on a metronome at 140bpm, chose trochaic metre.

And then 128 beats later we had a double margined piece of paper with something that could seem 'analysable' (or analysable enough).

I got a green pen to scribe those words, peppered poorly scribbled commentary on the indentations to fill the margins of the page.

And then you started looking at me differently, by the corner of your gaze. I swear the way you stared I'd end up going down in flames.

Your paper's at Farenheit 450, I seem to lack some heat. But I'm sure that by way of touch we can bridge that gap of one degree.

"What are you looking at?"

    "You have no idea, do you?"

"No idea what?"

    "I'm not gonna tell. Instead I'm gonna keep you forever so no one else can have this"
