There's no monster under beds,  
or skeletons inside of closets,  
the demon's within, and living idle,  
in polaroids, and bedside drawers.

You're a black room and I am  
the spirit of the silver nitrate,  
a buffered solution balancing  
a love inside a latent hate.

The pause in me, the vacancy,  
neither is misplaced or mistaken,  
but caused by the cruelty, in my  
asking for your name and title.

You asked why the intensity  
of my beaming garnet eyes,  
and I wish that I could answer,  
but can't do so if we end tonight.

But you reject the offer,  
say this ship has sailed,  
that a rewind to friendship,  
needs a toll that we can't pay.

And that's okay.  
I had fun on Thursday.
