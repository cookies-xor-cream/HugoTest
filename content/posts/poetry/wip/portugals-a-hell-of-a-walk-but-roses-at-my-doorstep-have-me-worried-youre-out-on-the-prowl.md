Every concession that I never made,  
has been clawing at my chest,  
like a cough that never tastes my lips,  
that instead lays dormant and repressed.

Fuck tension, this is torsion,  
of a cataclysmic proportion,   
I'm a table that shouldn't stand,  
without another rope to hold my hand.

So pin me up onto a cross,  
coz I've worn it far too long,  
to know there's some conversation,  
in which I might belong.

I've been at home for far too long,  
I miss sleeping on your canap√©,  
but since then it's been refurnished,  
and there's nowhere left to lay.

I hated these four wall,  
missed sleeping with the comfort,  
that you were a hallway door away,  
on the off chance rapture erupted.
