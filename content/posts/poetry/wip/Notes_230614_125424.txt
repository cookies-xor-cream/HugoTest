Fractional Distillation

My friend pointed out all the girls who've liked me are alcoholics.

But I empathise with that, forever sounds like a hell of a prospect. If I was scared too, I'd rather be drinking than buy it.

I hate you so, dear,
But I'll still beckon you hither,
Like the last freeze of the winter
That is making me pleasantly shiver.

Like the first bloom of the spring,
Or the last fall of the autumn,
Like foliage falling from filters,
As they're shedding their cotton.

But you're a midsummer night's shower,
That has turned fetid and rotten,
So pray tell to me dear,
Now that you're flush with this power,
Why are you flooding the flowers?
Why do you instil me with fear.

Does it feel good
To know you can tower?
Does it feel good
To distill me till clear?
