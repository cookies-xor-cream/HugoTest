Blacking Out In The Park In A Dream  
I had a dream where we met,  
And then she stabbed me to death in the park,  
Well, she gave my knife back when I saw her after,  
I don't know if I trust her but I guess that that's a start.  
I had a dream where we met,  
She didn't need to carry weapons,  
Coz the memories that I left her, and the words  
That she could forge, were  
so  
much  
fucking  
leverage.  
I had a dream where we met,  
But this time it was me who picked the fight,  
Remembering that manta that none can hear us scream  
In this vacancy, except the stars that fade from sight.  
I'll tuck her away,  
Into a quieter part of the night,  
And we'll stay and fall asleep.
