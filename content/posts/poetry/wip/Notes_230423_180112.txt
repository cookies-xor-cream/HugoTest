I Should've Asked To Be Taken To My Doorstep, And Stayed Home

My heart sped up, little by little,
Started to move ahead paces at a time,
Further in front of where I would walk,
Tracing out the parkside climb.

I shouldn't have opted to walk any distance,
Not alone, not around these shrouded parks,
They're lit up but there's something about
The fear that makes them grow infinitely dark.

Either way, when I reached home,
I decided on a prompt exit to the street,
And a couple more hours on my feet,
To drag out tonight, and miss my sleep.
