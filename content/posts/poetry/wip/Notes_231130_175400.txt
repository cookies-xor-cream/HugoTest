A Year Long Seasonal Love

When autumn falls to trim the leaves,
Or spring casts blossoms into streams,
I know with every breath we breathe,
That you're the only one for me.

Through winter wind on howling nights,
Through summer's cresting heat and light,
I know you're the only one for me,
That's how it was always meant to be.
