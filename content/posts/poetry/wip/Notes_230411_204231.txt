The Pandora's Box Of The Affection Currency Exchange

There's a thousand things I'd never do,
I think my problem here's that it was with you,
Knock me out, and don't tell me in the morning,
What we did or how it was storming.

I loved her taser, would trade a kiss for a hit,
But my love for the sparks died a little bit,
When I started associating the zap with her lips,
You know I'd do anything to dodge having a fix.

I swear that her necklace built the static,
I could feel the fuzz reach out to my wrists,
Everytime my hands wandered back across,
They were caught by my very own northern cross.

For all the calamaity that we had tread,
She showed me proof that love was kept,
Under a lock to which I possessed the key,
You could drown in it, or choose to set it free.

She wasn't the first person I had felt it for,
But was the first for me to wholely stop before
Some hinting of a permanent splitting,
And so I thought a tragic end was fully fitting.

With the bedroom locked, the door can't swing,
A swansong for a cygnus that could never spread her wings,
I'll let the gemstone break the news to you,
I'm far from spent but far too overused too.

As the bedroom door hinges strained: too afraid to swing again,
I took a minute to gather and to collect all of my things,
You could keep what's inside, consider it your parting gift,
A consolation prize for a departure come this swift.
