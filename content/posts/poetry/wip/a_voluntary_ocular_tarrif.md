Her eyes were speckled,  
With bits of stardust,  
Something sparkling,  
That slowly rusted.  
It was leaving nothing,  
Just a pair of busted  
Ocular devices that  
So dearly cost her.

She stared down sparklers,  
She made eye contact,  
With the midday sun,  
Until it went black.  
I swear to god girl,  
If you got migraines,  
Maybe then you'd  
Defer by pain. 

But I think that I have,  
So little faith left,  
That you would use  
Your eyes the right way.  
Whether it hurt or  
Whether it didn't,  
The sun's a sin,  
And you're a sinner.

You're solely drawn to,  
That manic feeling,  
When stellar insides  
Hollow, spilling.  
The sun is empty,  
Just as you are,  
Your eyes have drowned  
In darkness well-sought.
