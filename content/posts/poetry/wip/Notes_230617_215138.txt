You Wanted Speed; I Wanted Completion
I'm In Love With Time: But You Love Attention

You said we can do this fast, or not at all,
I said we can do this well, or not at all.
I guess the overlap was 'not at all'?
So you asked me how the previous
Decade lived had been,
I spent it skipping funerals,
And running out of steam.

I've got tree spines in my hand,
But no termites in my arm,
I need arboreal terrariums
As prologue to this formic farm.

Wait for spring, I'll bloom,
I need to sprout some thorns,
If for nothing, then for spite,
For a rose must learn to bite
Before it can survive.

An Open Letter To Nobody At All

This book is living rent free in my head.
I think this picture is an examplar of the night. 
They made me feel nothing but you were in love with all the lights.
You broke my rule about no pictures, but I think that that's alright?

So Ms Shaky Hands And Blurry Eyes,
Thank you for my Thursday night.
