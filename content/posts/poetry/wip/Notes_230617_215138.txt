You Wanted Speed; I Wanted Completion

I'm In Love With Time; But You Only Love Attention

You said we can do this fast, or not at all,  
I said we can do this well, or not at all.  
I guess the overlap was 'not at all'?  
so you asked me how the previous  
decade lived had been,  
I spent it skipping funerals,  
and running out of steam.

I've got tree spines in my hand,  
but no termites in my arm,  
I need arboreal terrariums  
as prologue to this formic farm.

Wait for spring, I'll bloom,  
I need to sprout some thorns,  
if for nothing, then for spite,  
for a rose must learn to bite  
before it can survive.
