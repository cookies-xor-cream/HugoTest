You Wanted Speed; I Wanted Completion

I'm In Love With Time; But You Only Love Attention

You said we can do this fast, or not at all,
I said we can do this well, or not at all.
I guess the overlap was 'not at all'?
So you asked me how the previous
Decade lived had been,
I spent it skipping funerals,
And running out of steam.

---

I've got tree spines in my hand,
But no termites in my arm,
I need arboreal terrariums
As prologue to this formic farm.

Wait for spring, I'll bloom,
I need to sprout some thorns,
If for nothing, then for spite,
For a rose must learn to bite
Before it can survive.
