To be told without being told at all.  
The stutter on her lips is evidence plenty of it all.

You told me about her dying ask.  
when I exchanged my own first-hand,  
you assumed the request had symmetry,  
so unprivy to my hidden telemetry.

I made a request, put a transaction in play,  
and I'll know the answer by whether you reply 'okay'.  
this is a trapping of an olive-branch extension,  
and I'm catching you in this network's tension.

If you say 'no', I know the answer's 'yes',  
and if you accept, then you must profess.  
So unless your denial comes in double fold,  
the answer's clearly been already told.

I'm sorry I had to enact this gambit,  
I just needed to see it through, you know,  
didn't want to share my hand, so I did it through  
the implication of a zero-knowledge proof.
