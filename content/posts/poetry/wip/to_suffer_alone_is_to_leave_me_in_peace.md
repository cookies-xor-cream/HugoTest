I'm talking to the outline of a silhouette,  
a ghost stuck in the prison of a treeline,  
in the autumn leaves, all bleeding red.  
I can forgive but I doubt that I'd forget.

and the hurt of it all, the permanent rain,  
is that you felt it more than I must have,  
got a kid as a reminder of the pain.  
I can't stop the both of us from winding up insane.

I was here for you, you knew it too,  
everything that I would do,  
was to calm the water we're sailing through.  
but I guess that's not ever enough for you?

We're a boat in a flash-flood  
with the rudders long lost,  
and I wanna save the SS DumbFuck,  
but I'm not gonna be paying the cost.
