My phone was in her pocket,  
My headphones on her neck,  
We were connected at our wrists,  
By the bondage of her belt.

Her eyes were used to sunlight,  
But she was tripping up the steps,  
Unadjusted to the darkness  
Despite the hour we had spent.

She asked me for my contact,  
And I reluctantly declined,  
She asked me for a drink,  
I said maybe another time.

But she didn't take the hint,  
Suggested we have coffee,  
So we scheduled for today,  
By her will and her decree.

My brain has learned its limit,  
For I slept through each alarm,  
Squandering any feasibility  
Of 'maybe another time'.

Well I stood her up, I guess,  
I should learn to use my phone,  
Why agree to plans with strangers,  
When I'd rather just stay home?

At least equipped with her contact,  
I could send an SMS,  
Some generic lie that I
Rewrote and rerehearsed.

But now I'm waking up too late,  
With stupid questions on my mind,  
Like did she even show?  
And did I waste her time?
