Thanks Patrick, For The Ring: But I Think The Only Way Out Was Through  
"I told my friend to call me in 15 with an excuse to escape this"  
"That's fair, you deserve an exit"  
"You're not a bad person, you had a bad day"  
"I don't think that's a valid excuse, sorry to drag you out today. Twice, no less"  
"I understand what it's like, you're desperately along and I'm a ticket to some semblance of company. But you need to stay away, my oxygen theif"  
"There's some things you should know..."  
You've got galvanised liquor,  
I've got an anodised tongue,  
So our blood types mismatch,  
And so do our eyes.  
You've got three there in place,  
While I'm short now a lung,  
From your stealing my air,  
It's anxiety-wrought.  
Though this time around  
Our friendship was brief,  
I'm glad to have known you,  
Through the thick and the thin,  
My dear beloved,  
My little oxygen theif.
