You've got galvanised liquor,  
I've got an anodised tongue,  
So our blood types mismatch,  
And so do our eyes.

You've got three there in place,  
While I'm short now a lung,  
From your stealing my air,  
It's anxiety-wrought.

Though this time around  
Our friendship was brief,  
I'm glad to have known you,  
Through the thick and the thin,  
My dear beloved,  
My little oxygen theif.
