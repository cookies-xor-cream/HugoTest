"Kid, you are on fire, find some water"

*"And once I'm out, too wet to burn again, then what?"*

"Then, I suppose, the ocean can have your skin?"

*"If there's a fire on the Pacific and there's no monk to burn alive, did it ever burn? Did it ever light?"*

"You can't take a compliment, can you my sweetheart?"

*"Every life lived brightly flares itself into oblivion"*

I need a drink, I'm burning thin,  
Against this ocean that always fucking wins,  
For something made of liquid tamed,  
It's so violent as to crave skin flayed.

I need a drink in two week's time,  
Like an ember down my gullet  
That's sinking upwards-bound,  
As a flare for a help I never found.

I'm lost at sea, I need a light,  
Not the lighthouse kind, another type,  
A ship is craving all my kindling,  
And fuel is all I am tonight.

Set me alight, make a spark of me,  
I'm burning up, read my BAC,  
You'll find nothing here but aldehydes,  
Like I'm a whiskey feverdream.

I pray to god, my buoyancy  
Will break the surface, find the sky,  
Flicker at the peak of its ascent,  
Like a newly broken ceiling light.

And when the flame goes out,  
That's it drowning in the air,  
The crackle is it sputtering  
In a desperate plea for breath.

But a quiet death is all it meets,  
With no oxygen in lung-ward reach,  
Can't teach me how to hold my breath,  
How to dodge a luxless-wrote defeat.

The Pacific wins when light recedes,  
Cheats the sparkle out your throat.  
But when the sheen accords your eyes,  
Don't gloat, just keep in mind, it's going out,  
It was destined from the start  
just come here and to die tonight.  
And that is what it's come to do,  
It came out here to die with you.

No sparkle that's ever birthed  
Lives both radiant and sustainable  
Like a story preprinted for a death,  
An autobiography made to burn.

Book's are not good camp-fire food,  
They burn fast, but don't burn long,  
And once they are too hot to hold,  
Their words can never reach a tongue.

And I guess I'm at Farenheit 451,  
So you may as well discard me now,  
Like an anchor but that's upwards-bound,  
I used to be a paperweight, and now I'm a paperlight.

Whatever history that you had  
Has it woven in its ocean-faring fate,  
That you're stuck on the Pacific,  
Predestined not to fully immolate.

Whatever evidence you leave,  
Is circumstantial in this form,  
Like the ash that's remnant from  
A molotov cocktail down then up your throat.

Take the evidence you lived,  
And bury all of it alive.  
You've lost your pulse,  
You've got no light inside your eyes.

Let it fade away, cough itself to death,  
Let it churn and fizzle out, let go,  
You can hear the ocean knocking,  
But it's you who's at the door.

The water's come to reap your ghost,  
Wrought clean out of your embers silhouettes',  
And it's such a shame that ash forgets,  
A myth or distant memory is all the evidence  
That your story now has left.

And the ocean's come to take that all away again.
