Sleep Fast, The Night Sky Already Poured Down On Us

I got a ladder and a hammer held tightly in my grip,  
I'm scared of heights so I'm secretly hoping that I'll slip,  
but I make it to the ceiling, and I put my nail into its place,  
with a single swing Nyx then goes dropping fragments of her face.

In the dream that it was raining glass,  
I woke up fast, but was wishing it would last,  
because if there's one death that's worth the living,  
it's when the sky is armed with a dagger and it goes desperately digging.

I watched the night sky split in twine,  
convinced my lonesome self that it would turn out fine,  
but with each successive draw of breath I rose cuts above the sleet,  
we're out of bloodwork credit, you can read it on the balance sheet.

In the stuper of my waking moments I saw the chalk outline,  
marking out the premises for a self-inflicted crime,  
wrapping tightly, the chalk hemmed all of my skin,  
but every day it's getting dimmer, we're pushing at the rim,  

The line can't stay stuck to my blankets,  
even after the suicide, I've got the all of me that's left,  
curled up snug inside.
