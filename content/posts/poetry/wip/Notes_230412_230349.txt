I Get A Little Anxious Time To Time Drinking From Open Containers; It Made Me So Happy You Drank From Mine When Alone And In The Dark (Although I Did Down Half The Thing In Front Of You A While Back)

"The More I Learn About You The More Confused I Am That You Can Trust Anyone Or Anything. How Do You Keep People From Bleeding Together?"

She asked me how,
I did so many, so bad,
All lined up back to back,
With no stutter and no lag.

I told her that its easy,
That the infractions of a person,
Aren't contagious or in season,
But they're isolated treasons.

She said that he'd tried it out,
But his partner cheated,
He lost his will, gave up his heart,
Had never been so defeated.

It's times like these,
I'm thankful I've no memory,
That I forget the very thing,
I'm looking at in front of me.
