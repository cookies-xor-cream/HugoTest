So I tore a page from your journal, I picked up a pen,  
Not a blank one but one adorned with your personal hell,s  
And I thought for a moment, and was uneasy at touch,  
But was eased by the thought I'd never love you as much.

The bark, no I know, has the same face as her,  
I can't picture it fully, but know that it is the case.  
With oversized glasses, and a tally of cuts,  
And that waist-length black lustre in need of a cut.

It mimics how she splays all of her fingers,  
And how her hands linger angled at her arm,  
To clutch a book like a cat cub that's gripped by the neck,  
And a coffee at midnight, not nursed but beaten to death.

She has the violence of a feeling I long since forgot,  
Some festering suggestion of a terminal rot,  
A gangrene, infection, a wound from a war,  
A knife traced from dorsum, and then up to my arm.
