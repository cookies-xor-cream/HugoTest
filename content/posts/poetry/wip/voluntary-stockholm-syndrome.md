On love and war,  
I'd wager every star,  
I'd put all my money  
On 'we could have it all'.

We've come so far,  
From out the dark,  
But friendship's not  
A one-time stop.

We forgot the  
Journey on the way  
Is like a destination  
In which we can't stay.

Coz staying moving  
Isn't staying at all,  
Moving need freedom,  
And staying needs walls.
