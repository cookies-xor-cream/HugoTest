I Remember Thinking I Knew: The KK Thesis (Again)

I think by the final drink I reached a verdict,
But I'm not exactly the best arbiter,
I love my friends for the haunting water,
But I could go without a sitter.

So what's the call, what'd I decide,
I seriously can't not have it written,
The only paper in my pocket's
Scribblings and half-happy jitters.

I had the lucidity to know to choose,
But not to know that I won't know later,
I'll get the answer out in time enough,
I'm ready with my memories and a grater.
