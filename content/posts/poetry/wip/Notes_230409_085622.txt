I Remember Thinking I Knew: The KK Thesis (Again)

I think by the final drink I reached a verdict,  
but I'm not exactly the best arbiter,  
I love my friends for the haunting water,  
but I could go without a sitter.

So what's the call, what'd I decide,  
I seriously can't not have it written,  
the only paper in my pocket's  
scribblings and half-happy jitters.

I had the lucidity to know to choose,  
but not to know that I won't know later,  
I'll get the answer out in time enough,  
I'm ready with my memories and a grater.
