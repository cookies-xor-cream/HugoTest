She Made Effie The Same Promise (But With Some Dependent Clauses)

I volunteered to be catching rain,
Lost an umbrella in an empty exchange,
But I love collecting weather stains,
And to manifest mobile and rusted weathervanes.

Three transactions in a short-lived week,
My bleeding purple heart is so damn bleak,
But I can't help myself trying to feel,
Coz these nerves are now made of oxide steels.

My jaded zero-knowledge proofs,
Are the nash equilibrium in a zero-sum,
I'm so fucking happy that I have a roof,
And that tomorrow I'll get to see the sun.

There are worse things than to be alone,
There are worse things than to have a house
But never find a fucking home.
At least with Stephanie, I'm alone in company.

At least with Stephane I'm vacant with another
To keep the lonely out the vacancy,
But sometimes I feel like I
Shouldn't even fucking bother.

Sometimes I feel like life
Has got me drowning, got me smothered.
What does it even mean
To moniker yourself a 'lover'?

I'd rather see you capsized in
A flayed wide-open gutter.
