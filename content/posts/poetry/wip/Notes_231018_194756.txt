Gift Giving

I gave myself away, piece by little piece,
Gift-wrapped, placed in boxes,
Finding solace in that I had nothing left to give.

God premeditated a killing, decades in advance,
Comprised solely of gift-giving,
Finding me with bow-tie ribboned hands.

Honestly, I'm so afraid of Christmas,
I know I'll spend the holidays alone,
With nobody but you decorating my phone.

Recipients chose to package me in boxes,
To let the 'us' live in absence of an 'I',
Separating my parts: my brain, larynx, and eyes.

But I checked my voicemail just this week,
To find a festive mailbox made of it,
Containing your whole being, sent bit by little bit.

It's too late for my birthday, too early for that of Christ's,
But I've got voicemails full of presents,
Adorning this device like stockings in the halls.
