Think I'm running low on empathy,  
My heart can't make the vacancy,  
To give the slightest shit about  
Anything that has parted me.

And I can barely feel the past,  
It's a marathon, and we're too fast,  
With my eyes plastered on your face,  
My pulse is climbing at a dangerous pace.

"My glass, you... know the question".

"... is that a complaint?"

"Fuck you too".

"Request, or exclamation?"

Miscarriage got the kid,  
And traffic got her sister,  
Her mother parted too,  
But to an automotive tune.

God, I hate the second person,  
It implies that I'm alone with you,  
In the absence of a third to boot,  
And that's more than I could ever do.

I could never feel that way again,  
But I can't feel simply nothing either,  
I don't know what to do with you,  
I haven't faith, I'm not much of a believer.
