I Said Happy Mother's Day, Have A Splendid Life, But You Wanted Something More Conclusive?

I had a dream this weekend,
That your hands were glued to mine,
Stuck writhing in the flame,
And your skin: it came alive,
To bear the embers I discarded,
Is that something you survive?

I guess I'll never know,
Living life from through my eyes,
I didn't know if I should wave,
With our hands still entwined
You'd wave back too,
I was never so good at goodbyes,
When they were involving you,
And you can attest that that is true.
