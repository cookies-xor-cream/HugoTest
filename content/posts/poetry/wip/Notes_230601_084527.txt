Ãˆ Finito Ma Non Fino Di Leggere

I'd fashion this machine,  
With all these parts  
I've never seen,  
But the only thing  
That's left of it  
Is an engine  
And its heat.

I would stay with you  
And wile the night away,  
But I'll only dig a single grave.

Find me next it's raining,  
Then if you want, just maybe,  
We could play this game.

I'll dig up oil, you'll dig up water,  
Dig like we are on a timer,  
On Saharan rain.

I would call it fortune,  
But you would call it fame.
