Transdermal Ferrotransfusion: Sharing My Blood (It Feels A Little Uncomfortable, I Would Never Ask It, Not Even From A Partner. But It's Adorable You Wanted To/Offered)

Sorry I forgot to ask your name (and also about your sleeves). I want to know it, I don't have anything distinctive to name you by. How about The Countess? I don't want to name you for the blood though, that's not how I'll remember you (but now that I think about it, I doubt I'll remember you at all?)

I know you said it's not your normal route, but I hope I see you on the 115 again.

You asked if you could hold that hand,
When I said "right?" it was a question
Of direction, not directly invitation.
But you took it so invitingly to reverse our chirality,
To flip both of our polarities.

You swapped sides and put my coffee
In my hand, I don't fucking understand,
Why you'd ask for the bloody paw but
I think I found a swarm of butterflies
In your comment that my blood,
Like our drinks, was still lukewarm.

I don't like you, and I don't think you
Feel anything of that nature either,
I just made a promise to my friend and
Ghosts are a myth to me, but god damn it
She's a hell of a believer.

Is it really a first date with me,
If nobody is bleeding?

Unless wound agapped, my vitals are
Slowly seeping out my hand?

Doctor hit a vessel, not on purpose,
It was to no ends, and to no service.

Unlike an ex on a bloodbank-bound adventure,
Where kleptomania made an attempt
At the blood coursing through my treasure.

Some epiphanic insight before immediately passing out, huh.
First encounter is always perfect.
Good thing I have an bag-full of full stops.
(My sarcasm and sardonia need be more blatant, I swear)
