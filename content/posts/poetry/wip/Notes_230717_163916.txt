Transdermal Ferrotransfusion

You asked if you could hold that hand,  
When I said "right?" it was a question  
Of direction, not directly invitation.  
But you took it so invitingly to reverse our chirality,  
To flip both of our polarities.

You swapped sides and put my coffee  
In my hand, I could never fucking understand,  
Why you'd ask for the bloody paw but  
I think I found a swarm of butterflies  
In your comment that my blood,  
Like our drinks, was still lukewarm.

I don't like you, and I don't think you  
Feel anything of that nature either,  
I just made a promise to my friend and  
Ghosts are a myth to me, but god damn it  
She's a hell of a believer.

Is it really a first date with me,  
If nobody is bleeding?

Unless wound agapped, my vitals are  
Slowly seeping out my hand?

Doctor hit a vessel, not on purpose,  
It was to no ends, and to no service.

Unlike an ex on a bloodbank-bound adventure,  
Where kleptomania made an attempt  
At the blood coursing through my treasure.

Some epiphanic insight before immediately passing out, huh.  
First encounter is always perfect.  
Good thing I have an bag-full of full stops.  
(My sarcasm and sardonia need be more blatant, I swear,  
I never see semantics transfused or so transferred).
