If Only The Devil Were A Botanist

You've got a barbed wire touch,
Like a rosebush with metallic bones,
There isn't a single inch of you
That I can safely try to hold.

I swear you're gorgeous at a distance,
But you're plugged into the powerline,
You've got a transformer keeping
The current in your wires live.

And I would wait, bide out my time,
Until the batteries all start to die,
But you've a quarry's worth of lithium,
And it's so far from mining dry.

If I had a Faustian graveswap,
I wouldn't let her soul imbue with mine,
And instead trade your caustic carapace,
To donate her all your borrowed time.

Why the fuck are you asking "why"?
Don't you want to sell your soul?
Detach yourself from the crime
Of harbouring these accursed bones?
