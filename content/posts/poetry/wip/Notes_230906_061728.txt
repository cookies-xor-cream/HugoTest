Kill Me And Narrate It

I'm not asleep, by definition, on a technicality.
I'm a somniophilic insomniac that's stuck awake,
And I only wish to be put fast asleep,
But sleep is more than that which I can take.

If you wrote to me a story, I would hear the tale,
A stale recount of a stupid boy you met posthaste.
You'd tell me of the junction's Amber traffic light,
And its warning of this quickly halting pace.

You'd recount to me he stayed the night,
Of how he slept curled at the post.
You'd make jealous accusations more,
But he wouldn't care enough to try riposte.

A parry's only as good as that
Which you harbour in your off-hand.
A stab is only as sharp as this
Edge of that which you command.

And your blade, it hasn't bite,
The spite of it is in the hilt,
It's where you hold it in your fist,
And that tension won't persist.

For you put the 'ease' in a 'cease and desist',
That marks an end: the finish to this tragic tryst.
