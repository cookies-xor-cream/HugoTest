Even A Blank Cheque Won't Cover The Invoice For The Repair Of The Ship Of Theseus: Forget The Ocean, It Can't Even Handle Rain

I'm talking to the outline of a silhouette,  
A ghost stuck in the prison of a treeline,  
In the autumn leaves bleeding red.  
I can forgive but I doubt that I'd forget.

And the hurt of it all, the permanent rain,  
Is that you felt it more than I must have,  
Got a kid as a reminder of the pain.  
I can't stop the both of us from winding up insane.

I was here for you, you knew it too,  
Everything that I would do,  
Was to calm the water we're sailing through.  
But I guess that's not ever enough for you?

We're a boat in a flash-flood  
With the rudders long lost,  
And I wanna save the SS DumbFuck,  
But I'm not gonna be paying the cost.
