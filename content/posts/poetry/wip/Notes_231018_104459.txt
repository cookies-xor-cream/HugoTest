Butterflies In My Stomach (This Isn't How You're Supposed To Feel When Slapped, Is It?)

I stood there gargling on the taste of blood,
Staring at her consoling her shaky jolted wrists,
She was blurry behind the acrylic frosted-glass,
Like watching a butterfly behind a window screen.

I suppose there's a hole found in the panel,
Because somehow she had reached right through,
Stretched to slap me me full-force across my face,
To stick larvae in my mouth long since overdue.
