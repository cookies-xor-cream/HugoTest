Faster Than Light, Forever In Darkness

Moonlight's debounced sunlight,
And eyelight is stretlight reflected twice,
Once from her and once from the stop sign stood besides us.

I told you that I wanted this,
You told me there's nothing you want that you could see.
But graced by matching eyelines, now you're stood here telling me:
You were stupid, FTL, employing breakneck haste with me.
