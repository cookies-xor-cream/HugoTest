Erasing The Atlantic Off Of Every Map: The World Ends At Panama, And The Two Of You Are At The Other Edge

You know what you did,
But I know what you need,
I'll forgive and forget,
If it means that you're happy.

There's a long list of mistakes,
That I can't seem to retract,
But morality's a question of opinion,
Not a statement of fact.

I already misconstrue the events,
To make you seem

I would trudge to world's end
And walk willingly off the edge,
If it kept a single one of us
From teetering off this ledge.

I concede most the arguments
That I feel like I'm in the right,
Because as great as winning is,
We lose if we choose to fight.

My heart is spilling over,
With enough to pay the blood tax,
And I have more than enough fibronogen,
To set us on all of the right tacs.
