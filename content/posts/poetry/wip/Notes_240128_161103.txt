Me And Little Miss Spoken Word

"You use metre when you speak to her. The two of you seem like a pair,
For I get prose and paragraphs when she gets lines all well-composed,
You speak to her with heavy words, each clause sounds so well-rehearsed,
Like speech with her is time well spent, in a life so poorly lead".
