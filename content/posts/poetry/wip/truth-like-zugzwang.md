Your breath crystallised, hung like a glacier on the icy air,  
I doubted it was cold enough, but the proof was sitting there,  
I pointed out the missing marks, but I shouldn't have,  
coz you asked me then if I had seen all of her scars.

And I knew the question after, would come so fast, and come in sequence,  
and when asked about the ones undershirt, my reply would make no sense.  
Because the truth sounds like honesty's blatant fucking end,  
why does it sound like lying if I'm to claim that she's only a friend?
