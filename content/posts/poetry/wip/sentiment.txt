I Hate Your Sentiment So I Rewrote Your Declaration Of Love As A Declaration Of Mutually Shared Isolation

Y'know that 'twixt the infinite entrapment of this Seoul appartment's encasement,
I'm sitting at the lattice, stuck staring with gaze galling, galeing to the pavement,
I'm a stranger in these walls, an alien dressed as a ghost down winding halls,
Sans you, I've the estrangement of a serial killer's basement: the only curse that I can host,
A mumbling of my finite love come from an empty space,
Come from the empty haunting of an empty ghost.

I'm not a banana, or a white girl,
Or a lumberjack without a forest,
Please disregard my red and checkered jacket,
Please ignore our tasteless matching flannel,
I'm an alien passed as the blood-curdling of a ghost,
Watching from a distant land, as you unravel and unfurl:
You're a sponge but dissolve and can't ever absorb.
