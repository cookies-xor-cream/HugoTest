A Phonecall's Recount: Subject 3
Sorry, I Don't Know What Happened. Something Felt Off About Your Boyfriend: This Wasn't A Flashback

She told me she was proud,  
I was able to trek this far into the story,  
But asked if I was numb or unafraid,  
To cut her loose, to put my boundaries up in place.

I told her I spared myself the misery,  
That thing was on the precipice of  
Starting to kill, then bury me.  
And I can't live like that.

I told her it's just the context to  
The rest of it; then all the enjambing  
Awkward pauses convinced her  
To be thinking in my likeness.

Pari became everything,  
That I had never been asking for,  
And had never said I wanted,  
Why the fuck did I thaw her out?  
See this stupid thing restarted,  
Why the fuck is she so dauntless?

She's slipping out my nightmares,  
I haven't seen her there all week,  
And her face is always censored,  
It plays a recluse in my dreams.

But I saw her in my wakefullness,  
An encore for the wave of terror,  
That made me drop his questions,  
Hanging stagnant on the air.

His hand had come too close to mine,  
Held a pistol up to time himself,  
As it froze to play my nightmares out  
And stow itself higher on the shelf.

I don't think that he noticed,  
His fingers felt arachnid,  
Built the tension into torsion,  
The vascularity into an ECG,  
That saw my pulsing pointing,  
Away from him and straight back into me.

And it didn't make a lot of sense,  
Why a brush between out fingers,  
Was the tumbling sans call curtain fall,  
That saw me unthread like a ball of yarn.

Contact with her wasn't a problem,  
Was it never, or had we solved it?  
Well I couldn't tell, and now can't do so,  
I guess the paranoia comes and goes,  
As it gets the impulse to.
