Hostage To Salty Eyes: You Need To Go Home

"You only call me P when you're upset"

The branches made a connection with my face, and so I was coughing up twigs and leaves for the rest of the night. But between each stuttering arboreal breath, I'd catch a glimpse of you, further out your depth.

I mentioned I was bleeding on my bedsheets, but didn't know where from, or wherefore. You grabbed me by the bottom of my shirt and pulled it straight off. P, what in the fuck?

You reached into your pockets for iodine and cotton swabs. It made me and you feel too much like you and her. Not only the disinfectants, but the fact that I was too distracted to feel the cuts the past two weeks.

I asked you if they were deep, you told me they'd almost healed over. I commented that's a hell of a long time to bleed, and you pointed out I squirmed so violently.

I asked why not stop in the wake of ill reception, but you had no response. When I turned around, I saw you crying, got a monologue on how the neighbours couldn't watch your son forever.

So I told you that they needn't do, if you'd just fucking go back home.
