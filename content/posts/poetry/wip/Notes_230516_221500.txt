The Fae's Fashion Advice

"Fuck, you wore it *that night*, didn't you?"

You asked me where I got this hoodie,
Upon remembering, I felt the implication,
You asked me if it harboured any ghosts,
I didn't like that insinuation.

It still fits me like it did eight years ago,
You said the green doesn't seem quite like me,
And I countered with a question of my own:
"How does that make you feel: at home?"

She started crying over the ghost,
Of an ex of an ex, or whatever she is
I suppose?

"I wore it that night. I normally wear it just at home now. The clothe's lost all sentiment, you know. It doesn't make me feel anything. It's not the corpus of any remembrance. It's a fucking jacket. That's all it is. That's all it ever will be".
