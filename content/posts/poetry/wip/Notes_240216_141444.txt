You're A Rose Planted In Carpet

Feels like every friend I had is slowly slipping out between my hands,
Could we please pretend it's all because the supply mismatched the demand?
You don't call me every day, and it seems that you forgot how to use the phone,
Please go touch some grass, don't fall victim to a wilting in your bedroom all alone.

"Hi, sorry I don't text back. How close you got to her... it feels like I have been replaced. There's nothing in my heart save for hate. I would tell you to come visit, but it feels like that could never be my place"
