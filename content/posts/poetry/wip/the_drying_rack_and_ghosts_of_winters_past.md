Please tell me you can feel my stress,  
My diaphragm's now so depressed  
That It draws in air until it pops,  
Until my lungs are made of rot.

I'm the cause for winter winds,  
I can't stop my breathing in,  
"So tell me child if you are cold",  
Like you could ever cull the storm.

"So tell me kid", I'll tell you good,  
"Please nod if I am understood",  
Her penchant for a lonely night's  
The winter's for its windy bite.

"Kill this kid", I'll end it fast,  
"Rid me of this vestige ghast",  
If ghosts could vacuum through air,  
Then trust you me, death would be fair.

But they are stuck to cling around,  
Like a jacket in a lost and found,  
Fully dry but half alive,  
Since they lost their grip on the clothing line.
