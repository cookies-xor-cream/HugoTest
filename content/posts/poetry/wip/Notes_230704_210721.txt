Conditional Love

I'm glad I caught you before the flight,  
Her condition's getting worse than expected,  
And I don't know the diagnosis,  
But I doubt it can remiss or fester.

So promise me this, that when you land,  
You'll hold her hands on my behalf,  
The transitive applies to touch,  
Tell her I'll miss her so fucking much.

I'm sorry, I can't hold this long,  
I promise you I'm not strong enough,  
For this posture to stand statue-still,  
An alabaster casting of finite love well missed.

So promise me this, you'll see her off,  
You'll weather whatever the end might have brought,  
Then read the eulogy at the curtain call,  
Or at the very least see the reaper stalled,  
Long enough that a finale's bought,  
But not long enough to see sufferance caught.
