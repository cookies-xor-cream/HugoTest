Life Asked Me To Fill In My Timesheet
Do I Tell It I Clocked Out Eons Ago?

I know that this was finite,
But I'll feel this way till forever comes,
Strapped knocking at the door,
To see to it that it's been nailed closed.

I know that I am short on time,
But I'll try my best until I'm down,
I'll count my breaths, and clock them out,
Save the little things that I could never
Clock back in without.
