Missunderstanding And Near Misses: "Why Does Your Suicide Note Say I'm Dead?"

The silence in the room had got so damn dense,
A ladder could stand upright just floating in space,
And I suppose that's good, we need the extra length,
Just come back down if the air thins and you're feeling too faint.

If attempted murder's how we score each other,
Then you must be two ahead, but I won't bother,
One slow, one fast, and one botched a little,
How come we can't shatter the glass if life is so brittle?
