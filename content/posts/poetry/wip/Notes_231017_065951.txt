Sleeping With Neuropathic Pain

It feels like fire, but it's cold like ice.
My hands contract, frozen like a vice,
In a blatant disregard for the importance
Of evolving my opposable thumbs.

She asked if I'm okay,
And so through bleary eyes,
And icy lightning streaks,
I tried to murmur 'yes?'.

She offered me her sleeping pills,
Something to quickly skip the night,
To try to knock myself out cold,
To spend my Wednesday lightly comatose.

But I declined the offer,
However bold, or brave,
Or perhaps just stupid
That it might have conveyed.

And so through the wanton shakes,
And intermissions of vocal breaks,
She grabbed my hands,
Made a seat out of my lap.

Said "we hold each other,
And I will hold your hands,
Until this pain can pass,
Then YOU will hold MY hands".

The way that my muscles always collapse
Feels like I'm an overcompensation for
The collision-course life has dealt so coldly,
Like I'm a single dysfunctional crumple zone.

And then she proceeded to fucking ruin it by saying "your hands never do this inside of me".

Incredible timing buddy.
Well received, well appreciated.
