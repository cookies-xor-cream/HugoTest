There's A Flower In This Desert, Should We Leave It To Die (I Know The Answer Is Yes)

(Are We Still In The Same Timeline Or Do I Have Some Common Fucking Sense)

Every monicum of sense strapped to me,
Tells me I'm an idiot to want to do it,
But the disconnect between my thoughts and words,
Feels like lying a little bit.

I'm told to listen to my better sense,
I'm told the omission is excusable,
And I'm happy where I am, I'll stay,
But this isn't a lapse, isn't exhumable.

And the ethanol could use a reduction,
By a methyl group or maybe two,
Coz the poison on my optical nerve,
Or in my stomach would keep me from you

I'm not out looking for anything more,
I just wanted to be crystal clear,
That we can let this plant bloom,
Or leave it to wilt downwards here.
