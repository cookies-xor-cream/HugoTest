Of all paints it's surprising cadmium yellow doesn't stain,  
I learned in first year it sticks around and bioaccumulates,  
And I don't like the way you play this game: lie, evade, divide,  
But sweetheart let me allay your fears: it's you, not him,  
You with me, not him, with me right now, right here.
