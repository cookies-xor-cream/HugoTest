"If You Like Cadmium So Much Why Don't You Marry Her"

The sky strung static all around us, I'm afraid of chemistry so I pictured a fire diamond on your head,  
I really think that that should be equipped upon the ring finger of the hand holding your alcohol instead,  
For you're an oxidising agent, with my post marked in your presence I feel I'm always short on charge,  
Like we're slowly reducing, like you're hunting for the end when only I'm pining for a start.
