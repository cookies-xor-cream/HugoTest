You're insatiable, but born that way,  
A ravenous craving here to stay,  
And the connection between those two,  
Is the intravenous vampirism inside of you.

If I could relabel you I would,  
A chronic curse, but seldom good,  
Maybe then my heart would beat,  
The way that we rehearsed it to.

It's a flickering light-up neon sign,  
Made of bold half-truths,  
And sloganeering lies,  
Like your neighbour's mid-August Christmas lights.

I wish it that this festive sight  
Could perforate your corneas,  
In an cataclysm of your eyes,  
Or a last shipment of flashbulbs for that guy.

I expect he might receive them soon,  
Immolated, through-and-through,  
Cooked well done, and into cinders,  
Marvellously fried, and seared inside.

I would've burnt them hotter,  
But I seemed to lack the time.
