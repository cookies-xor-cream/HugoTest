Saw Her Reading The Comic With Keller And Steinbeck Stacked On Her Lap. I Don't Know What Came Over Me I Gave My Beat Shot At A One-Liner

"Life is a short dull buzz,
Let me sharpen mine on you,
It'll be the last mission you fly",

Turns Out She Hadn't Read Either Of The References Yet Because That Line Took 2 Years' Time And A Continent's Distance To Work

I Never Intended It Like That
Don't Do The Math, All Four Of Us Ignored It

Read this hand and weep,
We'll get the willow loam and silt,
And give him the best view
From a gravel laden courtside seat.

Our match drew out at
9pm at your place every night,
It was a four hour walk each way,
I loved the stroll, but the timing was too tight.

I missed so much sleep,
Was sedated both ways home,
But the nightmare let loose
Wrote better than I ever could.

This was a picture book,
A collection of perfect tiny stills,
With a vague suggestion of a story,
That you would never fill.
