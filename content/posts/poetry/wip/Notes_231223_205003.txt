The Catalyst Running His Mouth At Me

I'm not gonna watch you two burn out on each other over the next few weeks.  
And I can tell by how you talk that it's chemical, but all it is is chemistry.  
Keep the reactions far away from me, I want to stay at bay,  
I can tell that this will die with you, but I bet you already know,  
So who am I to run my mouth, recount it back at you?
