Cancer-Spangled Ambivilance: It's Perfect, I Hate It

You spent the weekend in my dreams,  
We rewound time, and turned fifteen.  
If I could rewrite this disasterpiece,  
I would wipe out all the "no"s.

My dictionary's almost empty,  
It's made of "stops"s  
And glottal things,  
And suggestions you should go.

I suppose that I yet might need  
My thesaurus reprogrammed into me,  
To let sisyphean synonyms exodus,  
And this search for words seep out of me.

With Paris I had felt  
The inkling of a "yes",  
Slipping back into its place.  
That's why I know her name,  
Or at least that's my only other guess.

My final one is  
A substitution,  
Of 'bipartite' in place of  
This bimodal distribution.
