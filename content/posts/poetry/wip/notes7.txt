Cancer-Spangled Ambivilance: It's Perfect, I Hate It

Cancer's got its claws in you,
I dreamt you were victim to a crab,
And Ursa minor tried his best,
To pry you from its hands.

You spent the weekend in my dreams,
We rewound time, and turned fifteen.
If I could rewrite this disasterpiece,
I would wipe out all the "no"s.

My dictionary's almost empty,
It's made of "stops"s
And glottal things,
And suggestions you should go.

I suppose that I might yet need
My thesaurus reprogrammed into me,
To let sisyphean synonyms exodus,
And this search for words seep out of me.

With Paris I had felt
The inkling of a "yes",
Slipping back into its place.
That's why I remember her name,
Or at least that's my only other guess.

My final one is
A substitution,
Of 'bipartite' in place of
This bimodal distribution.
