Cancer-Spangled Ambivilance: It's Perfect, I Hate It

You spent the weekend in my dreams,  
we rewound time, and turned fifteen.  
if I could rewrite this disasterpiece,  
I would wipe out all the "no"s.

My dictionary's almost empty,  
it's made of "stops"s  
and glottal things,  
and suggestions you should go.

I suppose that I yet might need  
my thesaurus reprogrammed into me,  
to let sisyphean synonyms exodus,  
and this search for words seep out of me.

With Paris I had felt  
the inkling of a "yes",  
slipping back into its place.  
that's why I know her name,  
or at least that's my only other guess.

My final one is  
a substitution,  
of 'bipartite' in place of  
this bimodal distribution.
