I'm So Much More Eloquent When Blackout Drunk  
"Any chance you remember writing the eulogy?".  
"I wrote a eulogy?".  
She got an old binder, filled with my handwriting, and on finding the page, she began reading. It was titled "There Are Worse Things Than Death":  
"Life took her hostage,  
And her escape plan was to serve her sentence in full.  
The thing about cages is that they can hold the body, but never hold a restless soul.  
To hold a spirit captive, you have to convince it to play its own jailer.  
And even after it's been locked up, you have to convince it not to seek asylum in heaven.  
It's fortunate for everyone who's soul is so weighed down, as her's was, that the buoyancy of the spirit can only be tracked with infinite measures.  
My final regret is that she left knowing precisely what evil she was capable of, completely in the dark that she was a fallen shard of heaven.  
I pray the tired angel has her wings clipped, for I know she will float regardless.  
I hope she finds forgiveness in death, of the magnitude as the forgiveness I extended to her in life".
