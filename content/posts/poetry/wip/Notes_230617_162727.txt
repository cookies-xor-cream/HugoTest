I'm Twice As Far From Her As She Is From Me

The only thing I want to is to want to.  
and recursively I want that too in turn.  
yet still, amidst the infinite wist of wishful thoughts,  
I found missing the pension reserved for obsessive thoughts.

I'm obsessed, not with you, but with obsession itself,  
the potential for infatuation sits out of reach,  
collecting dust, up on the highest shelf.
