The ocean's like an anchor in my chest,  
But I'm not ready to port this ship quite just yet,  
Petition the harbour master to give away our spot,  
Tell him Charon needs a second of his time.

I'm not ready to crash-land at this time,  
I may have control of the schedule and the charter,  
But I'm helpless to the wall-time on the clock,  
For it's in analogue, and I'm reading it all wrong.

I swear where I am Elysium's an hour behind me,  
And a rewind, heaven-sent, would set me free,  
Don't tie me to the mast, I'll exit out to sea,  
Where time would close the distance onto me.
