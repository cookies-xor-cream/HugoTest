When autumn falls to trim the leaves,  
Or spring casts blossoms into streams,  
I know with every breath we breathe,  
That you're the only one for me.

Through winter wind on howling nights,  
Through summer's cresting heat and light,  
I know you're the only one for me,  
That's how it was always meant to be.
