I Can't Do A One-liner On Demand

I can see your face reflect,
off my own two bleary eyes,
as I try to dodge the fate that waits
in my pending teary sighs.

I wanna wrap you in a blanket,
but I dont quite know your size.
so we either risk your suffocation,
or you freezing in due time.

I can't seem to think up lines,
and it's not for cause of my lacked time,
just that I can't write the thing,
I mean, I can barely even try.

I just want to break the lock,
to figure out this final rhyme,
to the single try one-liner of a
pickup line one-timer,
but I can't quite find the line.
