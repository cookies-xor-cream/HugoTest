I Can't Do A One-liner On Deman

The Strangest Parting Gift I've Been Asked For Is A Pickup Line. He Brought Paper, And Pen, And Everything In Preparation, But I Can Only Write Down What I Feel. None Of It Is Brief Enough For One Line, I Mean, Look At My Titles.

I can see your face reflect,
Off my own two bleary eyes,
As I try to dodge the fate that waits
In my pending teary sighs.

I wanna wrap you in a blanket,
But I dont quite know your size.
So we either risk your suffocation,
Or you freezing in due time.

I can't seem to think up lines,
And it's not for cause of my lacked time,
Just that I can't write the thing,
I mean, I can barely even try.

I just want to break the lock,
To figure out this final rhyme,
To the single try one-liner of a
Pickup line one-timer,
But I can't quite find the line.
