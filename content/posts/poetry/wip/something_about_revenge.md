15 minutes. A really fucking not half bad 15 minutes though

I'm so sleep deprived and I  
Want to document Tuesday midnight  
But I doubt that I am able  
To transcribe this redundant fable.

Something about a scorpion,  
Something about a frog,  
Something about us being right,  
Something about it feeling wrong.

Something about Mr Kafka,  
Something about how it seems  
These conversations are...  
Nothing but endless fluff to me?

Something about a quote,  
That I can't seem to hold enough  
Of you inside my hands?  
Buddy, you fall in love too fast.

You know I hate that snippet,  
My hands don't need to hold  
Anything outside of yours.  
I'm not in love, simply fucking bored.

Something about red flags,  
Something about dental trauma,  
Something about the cataracts  
Of the atarax of a toothy soma.

Something about passing notes,  
Something about pencil lead,  
Something about writing letters  
That you always forgot to send.

You handed me that scribbled slip,  
Flipped it around to read the back,  
I asked you for an instrument  
You claimed that you had lacked.

So you handed me a knife,  
And I wrote my words in cuts,  
"The only part of you  
That will never be enough,  
Is whatever segment is  
Sitting in my mouth...  
This was fun, but my heart rate's up,  
And I doubt that I would ever fall in love".

She asked "with me, or do you think,  
You mean that completely and totally?",  
And I was sorry to inform her so:  
"Sweetie, it's not that I don't think  
I have it in me, it's that I don't think  
I have it in me for you, for this,  
So maybe we could forget it,  
Could we forget it, buddy, please?"

And she agreed to fracture, separate,  
Because resistance can be of use,  
But can never a friendship make.
