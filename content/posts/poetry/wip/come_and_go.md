Isn't it funny?  
How life comes and goes,  
How death stalls and stows,  
how things eb and flow?

We all come the same way that we go,  
I entered here not knowing you,  
And I intend to leave alone.

We all come the same way that we go,  
In a wanderlust, a haunted roam,  
Looking for a home amidst the drift.
