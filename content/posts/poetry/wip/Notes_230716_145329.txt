Ink And Jewelry

My hand's been mauled into a trinket,
It's leaking rubies, I wanna wring it,
I suppose she beat me to the thing,
When she forgot it and then she squeezed it,
I lost a couple millitres of jewelry,
But in the form of a rusty crimson ink,
Though I'm not fussed I had no plans to use it,
I sure as hell never gonna drink it.
