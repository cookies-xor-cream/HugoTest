Blood Like Ruby Diamonds

My hand's been mauled into a trinket,
It's leaking rubies, I wanna wring it,
I suppose she beat me to the thing,
When she forgot it and then she squeezed.
I lost a couple millitres of jewelry,
But in the form of this rusty crimson ink,
Though I'm not fussed, I had no plans to lose it,
I sure as hell am never gonna drink or try use it.
