I threw the flowers in the bin at the park,  
Shouldn't've read the tag: "I'll see you soon enough",  
Hell of declaration for anyone to send,  
Don't know what purpose it might serve or protect.

I cut my hand on the thorns,  
Feels like the bleeding's forlorn,  
Just tell me if the purpose,  
Was to depress or impress.
