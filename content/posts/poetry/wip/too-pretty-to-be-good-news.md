I threw the flowers in the bin at the park,  
shouldn't've read the tag: "I'll see you soon enough",  
hell of declaration for anyone to send,  
don't know what purpose it might serve or protect.

I cut my hand on the thorns,  
feels like the bleeding's forlorn,  
just tell me if the purpose,  
was to depress or impress.
