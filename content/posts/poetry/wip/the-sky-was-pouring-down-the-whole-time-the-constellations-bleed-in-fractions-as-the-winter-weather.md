title: "The Sky Was Pouring Down The Whole Time: The Constellations Bleed In Fractions As The Winter Weather"

I shot a bullet with my vision,  
straight into the sky, a new division,  
I saw the casing leave a hole,  
and fall back down to earth below.

A shooting star across the nimbus,  
a stratospheric streak like a cactus,  
caught prickling at my eyes, promised oasis,  
but feigned as a desert in disguise.

This is the farthest I can reach,  
with no propulsion for my gaze,  
the farthest scar that I can leave,  
in the sky which will stay unfilled.

Then the sting poured back as rain,  
chartered as teardrops for the pain,  
that I punched into the roofing,  
a route of refund by the bleeding, proving...

I've got ammunition for an encore,  
but I'm missing a use case for it,  
I'd birth new stars but I'm dithering,  
over where to place their flickerings.

I just want a night,  
that comes as it  
has been advertised.

I just want a fire,  
that can find all the fuel,  
it needs to climb higher.

I want the tower of babel,  
but built out of flame,  
to reach and to ramble.

I want the dusk found in shambles.  
and if it grows out a hand,  
then I'll say to it this:  
"I have but a single demand,  
send a firing squad of clouds  
to shoot me where I stand".
