title: "The Sky Was Pouring Down The Whole Time: The Constellations Bleed In Fractions As The Winter Weather"

I shot a bullet with my vision,  
Straight into the sky, a new division,  
I saw the casing leave a hole,  
And fall back down to earth below.

A shooting star across the nimbus,  
A stratospheric streak like a cactus,  
Caught prickling at my eyes, promised oasis,  
But feigned as a desert in disguise.

This is the farthest I can reach,  
With no propulsion for my gaze,  
The farthest scar that I can leave,  
In the sky which will stay unfilled.

Then the sting poured back as rain,  
Chartered as teardrops for the pain,  
That I punched into the roofing,  
A route of refund by the bleeding, proving...

I've got ammunition for an encore,  
But I'm missing a use case for it,  
I'd birth new stars but I'm dithering,  
Over where to place their flickerings.

I just want a night,  
That comes as it  
Has been advertised.

I just want a fire,  
That can find all the fuel,  
It needs to climb higher.

I want the tower of babel,  
But built out of flame,  
To reach and to ramble.

I want the dusk found in shambles.  
And if it grows out a hand,  
Then I'll say to it this:  
"I have but a single demand,  
Send a firing squad of clouds  
To shoot me where I stand".
