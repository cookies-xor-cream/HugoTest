"Isn't it ironic that the times you go to the doctor, you're perfectly okay? It's the ED or nothing with you kid, isn't it?"
- my new favourite quote

I feel like my life is played in episodes and the off season was this week,
The next few days look so goddamn barren, but next week looks so fucking bleak,
I keep putting my ankle out of commission, "kid you walk like you're on a mission".
Shut the fuck up, please, leave me with the last of peace I've got left in this remission.
