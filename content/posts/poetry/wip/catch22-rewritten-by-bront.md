I wanna call her, ask her why,  
This suggestion of an insult  
Of the best book I've ever read,  
Was so imperative to send.  

If I ask her why in anger,  
Then I've taken some offence,  
Which means I know exactly why,  
Thus annuling my defence.  

I need some pretence,  
I need some pretence,  
Can't you pretend,  
that I have the pretence?
