Miscalibrating Each Other

When you told me what you wanted
Didn't align with who we were to each other,
We promptly (and way-too-soon) decided
To severe every tie in decline of your offer.

You asked me for a souvenir, but I declined,
I don't want pictures to remember this curse by,
But I suppose that I received my remembrance,
When I awoke to a cough burrowed in my chest.

I thought that maybe yesterday my lungs gave up,
And thought it again, when I woke up better,
But soon I realised that I was carrying
The cold you were fermenting and festering.

The air's acetic, I can't taste anything else,
Guess my airways decided they were too tired,
And my lungs stowed away my breath
Somewhere far off, up on a shelf.

Stephanie, just because you can't direct it,
Doesn't mean you succumb to being a vector,
I would've given more to take back less,
Next time could we try to barter this distress?
