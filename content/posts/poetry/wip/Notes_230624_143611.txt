I Don't Want To Know The Diagnosis, Just Tell Me If It Hurts

When you go, come back again,  
Haunt me, please possess me,  
Take my body to head-height water,  
Then watch me drowning in the sea.

I want to watch a murder,  
Like the massacre at KHole Bridge,  
Spent half an hour treading river,  
I guess that that's my only niche.

I know I've killed a part of me,  
But not in any single place,  
I left them in these k-hole graves,  
Scattered along the way.

I think alive leaves a lot  
In the warpath of its absence,  
I'm gonna miss your wake,  
But you say they're all speak nonsense  
Anyways...
