The Album Cover Was A Wilted Iris

Fuck, sweetheart, we're a haunted house with a bluetooth speaker screwed tightly into place,  
A sonicscape more vivid in colour than the flowers neglected in the garden, picking up their quickly dying pace.  
A life ceased another life when the brown of your eyes pinned down this wilted iris left of mine,  
My pupils traced over the glaze left on your face from a bad attempt at the last lap of this godforsaken race,  
If we were a flower, it would wither stood in place, blue turned grey, exemplar turned to an antonym of grace.

I wish I would forget the bloom inside your eyes when I made our grave in the bedroom of your heart,  
That dumbfound playful tone juxtaposed, underscoring the soundtrack of this sandwiched Sorority Noise.  
I hate that all these blisters we inherited, wrestling the carpet down below all had to promptly go,  
To find a grave to die benign as the B-side to the back-track of the death of a cassette in a crevice labelled 'life'.
