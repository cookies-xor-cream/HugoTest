I found you dying under-wheel,  
Slowly crushed under the weight,  
Of a thousand tiny awkward moments,  
Stuck at tea-time with your ex.

He had his porsche keys in his grasp,  
And a compulsion that made him brag,  
He needs desperate help with reading cues,  
I'll lend him (the backside of) my hand for you.

Something didn't sit quite right,  
With the way he drove the dialogue,  
Forwent your name for 'wife' instead,  
Cutting the break-lines to his tongue.  
I'm sorry that in this conversation  
You have to be a passenger princess .

And I saw him lean too close,  
Supposed he was revving up the engine,  
To at his first chance, run her over.  
She's where the car was aimed,  
So I think that made me possessive,  
I ran up to her, and pulled her closer.

"Hey, don't.  
Just let him do what he wants to,  
It'll all be over soon.  
It'll be over soon".

...

Once the world sped him away,  
I came to talk, per chance to stay,  
And she said that it was nice of me,  
But she can manage just okay sans me.

"Okay? That doesn't look okay".

"Kid, who the fuck are you to say".

"A blind man could see that that fuckwit,  
Half the time can't drive between the lines  
Of social conduct or personal boundaries".

"And a man with vision could see instead,  
That he has half a decade that he's  
FUCKING HOLDING OVER MY HEAD".

Somewhere, in her anger, I struck wanderlust,  
I hadn't been SCREAMED at (not in anger),  
Since what felt like a forever away.

My thoughts enjambed and came in  
Threes. So incomplete.  
And for every bar, I missed a beat.

"Remember what I said,  
About killing romance  
Inside a kiss?"

"Are you really going to suggest it?"

"I would love to  
Suggest it,  
please?"

If she used an anacrusis correctly,  
This waltz would end now, directly,  
But my heart had time to skip a beat,  
When you cut the break-lines to your lips,  
And drove up my hands with both your wrists,  
In a violent lean without a kiss,  
In wait for me to agree to this:  
Proposed: "nothing more, we're only friends",  
So I replied: "we do this once, and then it ends".

You stuck to your promise,  
At least if you felt as I did,  
It was a hollowed out dream,  
Love without the loving in it.

A car without engine,  
Neither attraction nor heart,  
We started as friends,  
Then finished back at the start.
