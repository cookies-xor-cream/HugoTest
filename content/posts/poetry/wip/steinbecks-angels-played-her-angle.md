The grapevines in wrath,  
Twist and turn around my hands,  
They think that I don't understand  
To withdraw the anger from my slap.

And I think it's right in fractions  
Has omniscience for her infractions,  
But the violence that I choose to use,  
No matter how grave holds no candle  
To her abuse.
