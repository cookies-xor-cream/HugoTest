Love Was Never A Contact Sport For Me

You were caught inside a rainstorm,
frosted over, but writhing in the heat,
the only thing icier than me,
was your pair of fragile, frozen feet.

If our lives were just a dream,
then you could grab me by the collar,
and reel yourself
slightly closer in.

But I would always make you
keep some distance in between.

I would want your warmth
to boil the water off my face,
but these 36 too few degrees,
are all the heat that I'll want to
or ever need to feel.

There's nothing in my head,
in the absence of a kiss,
and that's a feeling
that I would hardly come to miss.

You asked how long that it had been,
the question's pointed, locked and loaded,
coz the only circumstance
where I'd receive the touch,
is with a flyscreen stuck
between the two of us.
