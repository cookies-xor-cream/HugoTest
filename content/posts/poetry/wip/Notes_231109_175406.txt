Any Landscape Is Gorgeous With You In The Foreground

The sun hung down low, but barely out of both our reach,
The sky so freshly rinsed that it was still damp with bleach,
It was grayer than it was blue, and even grayer than it was gray,
But however washed-out the scenery, I wished that you would stay.
