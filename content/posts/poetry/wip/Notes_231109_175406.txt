The Dismal Sunrise And Her 9am Shift

She looked so fucking different in the light, guess when I saw her last I was eyeing down my calendar, huh?

The sun hung down low, barely out of our reach,
The sky rinsed so freshly it was still drowning in bleach,
It was grayer than blue, and even grayer than gray,
But however washed-out, I wished that you'd stay.
