When It Was You, Me, And The Heart Monitor, Everything Was Okay (If Only For A Night)

You were the better bit of every bitter beat my heart could squeeze onto that faded LCD.

You were the worse-off half of every lie you never bought that the tachycardia was a vital sign of life.

You were the company I never even asked to see but knew that she should come to be with me.

Sorry, I know you made a reservation for today. But I did tell you that I had different plans. I did tell you that you were needlessly optimistic.

It's a shame your response was "I guess we all like to hurt ourselves sometime". Hell of a heartbreaker it must break to break her own heart.
