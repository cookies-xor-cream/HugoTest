Braxton Higgs Attractions

This day is a facade of a painful passing thing, so let's name its likeness 'braxton higgs',  
A hiccupped intent with only contractions to spare, you're leased as a rental but I'm out of rent,  
Here's for the tenant a tenet, but spice my advice with nothing other than a grain of your salt,  
Your pull onto me is a force without field,  
Unexplained by a substandard model that's missing the boson explaining the force that you wield.
