I Thought It Would Hurt

I thought it would hurt,
But embers burn your nerves,
And diminish the pain
That they intend to serve.

The cold and static's
The best delivery,
But also too fast
Of a recovery.

I can tell that it
Wants to make me bleed,
But blood is the buoyancy
I need to stand upon my feet.
