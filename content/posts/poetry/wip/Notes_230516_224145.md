Gradient Ascent

There's some days where it seems like people are put into place with intention.

But today, I can't figure out what the fuck the motive could've been.

Today's an infimum of a day,
A local maxima for this week,
The universe had a surplus of 'Max',
That I guess it had to bleed.

I feel so fucking weak when
Compared to cosmic coincidence,
In a short stint of a half-morning,
I found three, and shortly four it'd be.
