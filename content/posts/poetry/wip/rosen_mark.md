I have a scar placed upon my hand,  
And I can't quite fully understand,  
Why it's not mine and it's not Euphie's,  
Can my insecurity make this easier on me?

Of all the ones that stare down to speak,  
She make me feel the least at peace,  
So every time she brushes me,  
I hit her to try equate our peace.
