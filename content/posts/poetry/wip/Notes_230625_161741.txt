To Die Alone Is To Live Your Final Days Unburdened

She's got some friends in life,
But she's got nobody in death,
She'll leave with her final draw
Of a lonely parting breath.

And then it'll all be over,
This spectacle will close,
The only sacrifice it asked for
Were her fragile broken bones.

But I won't ever rest assured
That she had found her home,
At least she shed her shackles,
And her corpse was free to roam.

I wish I could keep her company,
As the lightness leaves her eyes,
But she's in derelict rejection
Of all forms of goodbye.

I tried to talk her into it,
But she reaffirmed her doubt,
She'd rather stay alone
Than to take her ticket out.

I only want to know the reason,
That she sent the blonde to spy,
She's playing recon matchmaker
To seek a cause to cry.

Not to project, but in her shoes,
I would quit my mind of this,
I'd have no reservations of the
Chances we have missed.

But regret is sharp and short,
It finds its words are few,
And finds itself sorely misplaced
When it finds its home in you.

The thing that I might most regret,
Is that I never got to know
The friends of mine before they left,
Before they had to go.

I don't think that I can doubt
The slander that we exchanged,
Not a single word captures regret,
Just the need for change.
