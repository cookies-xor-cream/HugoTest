I'm Assembled To Crawl

I'm a loosely strung assembly
Of these tiny moving parts,
Like anxious tweaker furniture
Assembled in the IKEA parking lot.

But she dismantled me and
Threw the instructions to the street,
She rewrote the directions,
To remake me how she sees.

She gave me parts I missed,
And saw some absence filled,
But I liked my old self better,
I'd rather be falling than have slipped.

She looked at me with bleary eyes,
The taste of whiskey on her tongue,
She told me to be quiet,
That it wouldn't take too long.

She lost a piece of her's,
And then in turn she thinks,
That she claimed a piece of me,
But I'm all that I ever was,
And I'm still all that I could be.

She lost a piece of her's
And thought she claimed a piece of mine
But im all that I could ever be
I'm nothing if not fine
