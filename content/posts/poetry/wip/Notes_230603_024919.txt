The Starlight Ceiling's Receding From My Touch

You can't see the sky,  
through canopy and overgrowth,  
that sits silently sheltering  
the location of this crime.

Maybe the naked view  
of the full and the shining moon,  
would've cut through all the misery,  
and let us sit calmer in our tombs.

Staring through the stratosphere  
isn't the same alone,  
it hits fucking different  
when it's with you.  
when it's with you,  
it feels like home.
