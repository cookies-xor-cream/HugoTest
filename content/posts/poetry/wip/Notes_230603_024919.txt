The Starlight Ceiling's Receding From My Touch

You can't see the sky,
Through canopy and overgrowth,
That sits silently sheltering
The location of this crime.

Maybe the naked view
Of the full and the shining moon,
Would've cut through the misery,
And let us sit calmer in our tomb.

Staring through the stratosphere
Isn't the same alone,
It hits fucking different
When it's with you.
When it's with you,
It feels like home.
