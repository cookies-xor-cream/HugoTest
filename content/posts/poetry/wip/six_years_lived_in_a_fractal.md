"As above, so below,  
the engine's running,  
but this vehicle, it  
doesn't fucking go".

Stop giving me second hand  
quotes of quotes of mine.  
we've reached the end of  
this godforsaken line.  
But I'm crawling before I  
learn to walk this time.

It's like a fucking needle in my eye,  
I gambled for some prisma but I only  
found shades of gray inside the sky.  
it's like a fractal in its illicit-birthed conception,  
whichever way that you might try to slice it,  
this shape forever holds its infinite retention.

As above, so below, however microscopic,  
or macroscopic, however far in or out you zoom,  
gowever hypoxic the height to which you go,  
it's the same thing the whole way down,  
a freeze-frame on a thin glass slide,  
a snapshot of an impending doom,  
but all we have left is time,  
an excess of thread plaguing the  
primal arachnid on the loom,  
biding out its time.
