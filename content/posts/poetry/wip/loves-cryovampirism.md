Your shirt and hands,  
meet my blood,  
a false positive sent  
as a marker for my love.

From blood and ash,  
and cinders scattered,  
rose your skin, so drenched,  
in a rosy, sanguine splatter.

I want my fangs,  
to meet your hide,  
but they'd sooner shatter  
than pierce inside.

My jaw is brittle,  
a maw: frozen, iced,  
teeth far too fickle  
to handle spice.

This volunrary green-out  
of horseradish dysfunction,  
burning through my palette,  
is no evidence of our gumption.

That was a false assumption.  
had it been true.  
I wouldn't have lost my heartrate,  
let it race apart from me to you,  
at such breakneck fucking speed.

The pauses now are random, and I'm talking off her ear,  
(just as she is with me in tandem).  
I don't know what set this thing in motion,  
but I know I'm lost in this ocean of commotion.

Vulpine, lupine, feline, marsupial.  
Each more precise, but a false alarm,  
the werewolf doesn't howl when the  
full moon's in decline.

So take your palms from mine,  
I'll hold you and tell you that it will all be fine,  
but you're towing the goddamn line,  
if you think that you could try  
to do this thing a second time.
