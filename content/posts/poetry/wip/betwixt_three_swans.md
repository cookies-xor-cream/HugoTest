She took a drag and slurred her speech,  
raised her hand to try touch the sky she'd never reach,  
"The stars are copies of copies of copies of,  
a soul we found lit up in heaven up above".

She then signalled to her favourite dots,  
and told me a story about a swan and his spawn,  
something about how she's the son of a war god,  
and the cross she bore was a lightning rod.

We came out the river cold, baptized anew,  
must've washed away our words, since we had so few,  
shocked by the daughter of the lightning deity,  
I lost my words in the sparking's severity.
