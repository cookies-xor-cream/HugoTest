I suppose that  
A little whiskey  
Hunted down and  
Now has found me.

I can't lock up  
From the inside,  
Can someone come  
And set me free?

If I can open  
The front door,  
I could walk  
The distance home.

I don't care  
If it is raining  
I am bound to  
Dodge the storm.

Not in lack  
Of hydration,  
But in a relabel  
As a shower.

I would catch  
The weathe gladly,  
If you would  
Only let me go.

Fortunately,  
I think I found,  
A path out  
On the wall.

I can only hope,
