Sorry, The Sea Swallowed The Last Of My Speech

I'd send a monologue but I'm happier knowing it'll never reach.

With each beat I stole a calorie,
from your utter luck of energy,
but if I could do it all again,
I'd forget to leave a note once more,
and we'd be even then.

Because you said it's not my absence that you lack,
but your transmutation to a dismal-dreamer,
that you underwent, when I chose not to write back.
