The Finale's Scripted

A no, or a yes, well either way,  
Does it matter what I try to say?  
I know you'll do what you would do,  
For you were only built this way.

A start, or a wait, well neither way  
Would I have ever let you stay.  
There's everything that you have done,  
So now there's nothing that you can say  
To see the past undone.
