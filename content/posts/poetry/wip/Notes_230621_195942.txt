If This Is Non-Invasive Then Why Do I Feel Invaded?

The technician said I was breathing fast,
But my heart's going faster at a mile a minute,
If I want to outlast the end of everything,
Then a lung of mine has got the air for that in it.

A third of my airways are full just in case,
Emergency airtanks sitting, waiting, idly in place,
I didn't know that cardiac muscles could stick tensed,
But my chest cavity's repleted the oxides that I waste,
Or at least, it's trying its very fucking best.

I've only drowned a single time,
So I'm running this drill unrehearsed.
Sometimes I fear she's watching me,
And other times, I feel that it's deserved

---

I feel it at appointments I make alone.
The dread of waking up dissociated,
With new scars, and fresh bleeding
That I couldn't quite seem to place.

I rummaged through everything
With delusions of literacy,
But being literate needs some sense,
And I had lost all five of mine.

But through my stupor,
Through the shallow fugue,
I must have held some clarity,
"She's not coming, is she?"

I asked that to no one,
The only other: a nurse,
Too enthralled in panic
To recall anything of language.

I was confused momentarily,
My thoughts were evicted,
In preference of a mechanical beeping.
Displaced bt machines and their screaming.

As the room darkened,
And in a final clarity, my eyes
Wandered to meet hers:
I saw it plastered on her face.

Something was wrong.
But it wasn't going to be.
Not for long, anyways.
Either exit was okay with me.

"Funny, aren't they. Those numbers. 
They say I should be sleeping".

She calmed for a moment,
Took another look at the LCD,
And suggested I should be
Somewhere deeper than a sleep.
