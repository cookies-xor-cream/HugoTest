I'll rename you Lucine or Celestine,  
Some title fitting of a lunar thing,  
A radiant, stellar, beaming light,  
A placid corruption that poisons night.

And tell me, my petra in the sky,  
Does air thin out way up that high?  
For it always knocks me out of flight,  
Into a comet running from a tail inbound.
