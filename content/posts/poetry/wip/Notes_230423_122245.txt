ParÄ«sa Broke My Head; People Pointing Out Habits I Stopped Is A One Way Ticket To A Relapse

I didn't give her context, I suppose she read it in my eyes?

"You say the one thing that you want,
Is to run out of these stories.
But I think you love life too much
To live it through quietly, or slowly".

She was saying something about me being a good listener. I'm not sure, I wasn't listening, was too lost in the ceiling.

She had me guess who's sister she saw in passing, watched the colour wash from her face as my guess converged on the answer.

She told me that she used the word 'fuck' in my regard, and her first thought on hearing was how pissed off I would be at language that crude.

I gave her a look like a slap, my anger was perhaps a smidge misdirected. But my head was vacuumed empty, clinging onto nothing but the picture of the ceiling.

My look waned, from a full slap to empty anger to nothing at all. And as she saw me ebbing she had some annoying need to comment that today, and last month, I seemed happy.

Not manic, thought I felt it, not euphoric or excited. Just happy and calm. Everyone I've known too well for too long has made that comment.

No nervous ticks, no stutters, no calculations for what exactly I should feel and say.

"Arya, I didn't intend to make you think through how you should control how you feel. You've lived so clinically, and it's not prevented anything stupid.

Make mistakes, but make your own mistakes".
