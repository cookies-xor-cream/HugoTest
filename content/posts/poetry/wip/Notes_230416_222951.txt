The Bottled Lightning Found A Springboard In Her Mouth

Found a page that got lost while reorganising my room. Thought I'd do a take on it, though the source is too long to put here.

Her tongue on ice, slipped on  
every thought of every word,  
then promptly ejected it,  
for she needed to be heard.

Though somehow the syllables,  
spilled over to her heart,  
taking it from a glass half full  
to a fully empty sight.

She choked out every sound,  
pushing out a phoneme string,  
that if unheard or unrequited,  
would reciprocate the dullest sting,  
and it would all go quiet.

"I would give my pulse to the static,  
I would trade every beat for a brush.  
I need to be defibrillated by your hand,  
I NEED to feel the rush".

She glanced over, fenced her stare,  
and it was evident that though they cared,  
there was no sequence of emotions that,  
they could ever dare.

"Give me your blessing not to stare,  
I'll wait and I will kill my time,  
by counting each and every hair,  
stuck fast to my avoidant eyeline".

She said the last part in her head,  
uncharacteristic of her words not to leak,  
but "god she's gorgeous",  
coiled firmly in her beak.
