The Watcher: Preface

Despite the abundant nothing,
That was so clearly unfit to see,
I was the final target of a gaze
That played a dying bee.

The Watcher: The Sleep She Stole

With a consolation worth of stars,
Locked behind those empty eyes,
Everything she cared to look at,
Took the shape of the northern cross.

The Watcher: A Recount

She detailed my nights this month,
Who I was with, when I was here,
There was a calmness in her voice,
That loosened and set open my fear.
