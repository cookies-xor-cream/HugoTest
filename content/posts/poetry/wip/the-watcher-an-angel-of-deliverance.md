Thank you for not letting me walk home.  
Thank you for not parking in the driveway.  
Thank you for turning off your headlights.  
Thank you for coming the last few steps.  
Thank you for snapping me out of my trance.  
Thank you for steadying my hands.  
If I thanked you for everything I would run out of words.  
I had the violence in my hand,  
That loosely grasped a tremor,  
And shook the key from out the lock,  
In the 'stay still or shake' dilemma.

The park held me as a moment's hostage,  
Beguiled by a promise of a morbid haunting,  
A dozen pairs of sable eyes reflected,  
And I could feel their n-ocular taunting.  
You called my name from at my side,  
So I turned to face towards my rear,  
To my angel that had walked me home,  
Through this street so gummed,  
so drenched with fear.
