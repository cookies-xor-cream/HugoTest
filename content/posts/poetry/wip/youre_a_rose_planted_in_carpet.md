Feels like every friend I had is slowly slipping out between my hands,  
Could we please pretend it's all because the supply mismatched the demand?  
You don't call me every day, and it seems that you forgot how to use the phone,  
Please go touch some grass, don't fall victim to a wilting in your bedroom all alone.
