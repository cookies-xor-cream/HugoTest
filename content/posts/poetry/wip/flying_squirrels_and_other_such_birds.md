There's something broken in the way we interact,  
I asked if I could stay the night so we could patch the cracks,  
And I'm counting down the fissures, all racing up your walls,  
Sat upon my hands, I feel so withered in your hall.

I'm so withered at your every chance to speak,  
I'll dejaw this bird, I'll pry the words, straight from out your beak,  
I know that you are teething, but I scarcely want to fight,  
I don't want to feel your gnashing, but I miss your overbite.
