Amber caught a firefly,  
I suppose that I am him,  
They make bugspray for  
Those little guys.

I wish that there was something,  
To ward away not bugs,  
But the gemstone that  
They are trapped within.

Inch by wretched inch,  
She's cutting distance  
Off the bark found  
Peeling off this bench.

Touch by anxious touch,  
And tug by nervous tug,  
She's acquainting her  
Fingers with my face.

If I had Amber repellent,  
I'd drop it in my glass,  
Watch them sink as dregs  
Slowly to their place.

I'd take a marathon  
Of anise and of fennel seeds,  
If it got me out this race.

I'd rather die than  
Sulk and sit and slowly  
Fossilise in place.
