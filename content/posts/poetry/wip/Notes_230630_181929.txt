"Fuck", I Hate That Word, But Here It's Justified I Think

You met a boy in the stairwell,
So I talked you into bravery,
That you previously were lacking,
To say something unsavoury.

He asked about the pill,
But you're on something stronger,
So you nodded, just thinking
"Right, when's he gonna fuck her...?"

Then to your (dis)pleasure,
The time went quickly as it (-- he?) came,
And once the evening had ended,
You still felt the same.

That's when you called,
You asked about my work,
I asked about the songs I sent,
And you told me that they hurt.

And you would've dodged it forever,
But your mother didn't raise a quitter,
So you cut straight to this topic
With an adorable non sequitor.

And when I asked you how it was,
You told me he sucks at listening,
And your head was stuck elsewhere,
In a gallery, permanently spinning.

I asked forwhenst your thoughts,
You said they ran and crawled,
Over the drapery and over the walls,
Spelling out:
"I would rather have taken this call".
