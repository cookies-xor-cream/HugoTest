I'll sell my soul as splintered things,  
Split wide webs of nerve endings,  
If it sent your name out through the router,  
But I know it'll stick as a pending offer.

Caught over water, with tremors due,  
Threads start to shake from under you,  
But you cling on by the slightest grip,  
Even though your footwork starts to slip.

Like a spider made of amberglass,  
You cut my face on frenzied hands,  
Your fragile web of splintered sand  
Caught a spark in a furnace blast.

Arachnid glassware's eluding truth,  
As string slips out from under you,  
A fragile network burning down,  
And we're both wrapped up in cocoons  
Entangled and fated to drown tonight.
