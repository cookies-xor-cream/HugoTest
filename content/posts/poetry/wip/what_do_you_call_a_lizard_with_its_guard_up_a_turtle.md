She worked the late shift, only saw me if I was free till late, till well past after nine,  
And I'd agree to meeting fully knowing that I can't live like this each and every night,  
I suppose that we disjointed, lost the page, we were living far too out of sync, fumbling on the stage,  
Like a movie in slow motion but with the sound still the same pace as the script.

And if I could read slower, or had a pen somewhere on my person,  
I would outline the discrepancies of our tension and our torsion.  
But we both fled in wild retreat, leaving turtle shells at the crime scene,  
And if you hold them up close to your ear then you wouldn't hear the ocean but our screams,  
The dulled yet sharp and endless lull of our infinite interpersonal incompatibilities.
