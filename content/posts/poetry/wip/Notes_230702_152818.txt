Alternative Readings Of The Sphygmomanometer

I was staring at the white-out wall,
So distracted from the sting,
By the thousand tiny blackholes,
When my phone began to ring.

I picked up, barely lucid,
Your voice shattered through the screen,
Spilling out elusive, with
Spectra that I've never even seen.

You asked about the scan
And I told you I can't talk,
But my doctor said "distract yourself",
So I guess I'll take your call.

I'm out now, walking home,
I threw up in the park,
Leaving a fragment of my haunt,
In the roses by the paperbark.

I'm out now on the way,
My pressure tends to one,
I know it's no quotient, gorgeous,
So stop spoiling all my fun.
