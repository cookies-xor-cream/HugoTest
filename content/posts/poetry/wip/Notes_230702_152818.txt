Alternative Readings Of The Sphygmomanometer

I was staring at the white-out wall,  
so distracted from the sting,  
by the thousand tiny blackholes,  
when my phone began to ring.

I picked up, barely lucid,  
your voice shattered through the screen,  
spilling out elusive, with  
spectra that I've never even seen.

You asked about the scan  
and I told you I can't talk,  
but my doctor said "distract yourself",  
so I guess I'll take your call.

I'm out now, walking home,  
I threw up in the park,  
leaving a fragment of my haunt,  
in the roses by the paperbark.

I'm out now on the way,  
my pressure tends to one,  
I know it's no quotient, gorgeous,  
so stop spoiling all my fun.
