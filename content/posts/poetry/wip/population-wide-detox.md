Hannah got insistent, and there's many things I'd put up with,
but persistence for this isn't in there on the list.
Please let it go, and let it die. Just let it disappear,
there's nothing here for you, so stop looking for it here.

Amber decided she liked my cup fuller than it was,
I asked her what was in it, but didn't read into the pause,
that she had to take before she said "just drink",
but I don't regret that, I'd still rather trust blindly than to think.

ParÄ«sa made me an offer that I don't think I'd take up,
and I know she knows coz she let me pour the drink in my own cup,
and I can't look her in the eye if she knows what Amber did,
I can't say a word and the silence grows too still.

Hazel chose to burn short and flame out quick,
her watchful eyes on night-time walks make me a little sick,
I never volunteered to be afraid at my own house,
never signed up for this game of perilous cat and mouse.

And I think that there's another friend
that has a brief place in this array,
but I'd rather not write their name,
I'd rather just abandon the dismay.
