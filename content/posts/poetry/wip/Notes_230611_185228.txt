Elizabeth's Wedding: Ab Inito, Sed Non Ab Ovo

I'm so fucking bad at weddings,  
And im even worse at funerals,  
Replied that I'm not going  
On all the ones that I've been invited to.

But I suppose that this time  
It's different, and I should go,  
Because for the first time in forever,  
I actually do want to.

I remember showing at a wake,  
It was being held for Arya,  
And it felt a little awkward,  
That we both shared the same name.

The entirety of the invite list  
Was 20-something drunkards,  
Sneaking booze till half-asleep,  
Like a wake of broke-willed buzzards.

Maybe it was just a brown-people thing,  
But they were all adorned in black,  
Fancy fantastic drapery,  
That my wardrobe sorely lacked.  
(I don't think elegance looks too good on me,  
If I was to respond perfectly honestly).
