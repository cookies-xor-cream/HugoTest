title: She Always Woke Up Fucking Screaming

Nightmares made her so afraid to sleep  
I got them too, but I don't feel them so strongly,  
Whereas you're desperately in need of the numbing.  

I wish she'd cut her nails,
whenever she slept poorly she'd leave marks all over me.  
I woke her up to tell her  
To take her sleeping pills,  
She called me fucking stupid,  
But I just wanted to let  
The Dreamer dodge her dream,  
As dumb as that may seem.
