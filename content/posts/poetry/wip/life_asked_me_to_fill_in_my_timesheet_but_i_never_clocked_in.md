I know that this was finite,  
but I'll feel this way till forever comes,  
strapped knocking at the door,  
to see to it that it's been nailed closed.

I know that I am short on time,  
but I'll try my best until I'm down,  
I'll count my breaths, and clock them out,  
save the little things that I could never  
clock back in without.
