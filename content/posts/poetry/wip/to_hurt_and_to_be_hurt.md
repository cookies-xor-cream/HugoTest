Each and every paragraph  
weighed heavy like a slash  
that sits holding down my heart,  
in quiet recession to the dark.

I walked past rose, sitting still,  
in the middle of the park,  
stationary, a statue on the seat  
where she awoke the numbness  
still trapped inside of me.

I know, gorgeous, you have thorns,  
but I thought I prayed them all away,  
you still have the same splatter on  
the jacket that you had worn.  
And I want to shred it, through and through.

You asked me what I choose to bleed  
that it can't be simply washed away,  
found me speechless, losing words,  
dropping sentences that I meant to say.

I walked her silent to her car,  
I needn't paragraphs for the transience  
of every wound, and every scar,  
they dig forever deeper,  
looking for their marks.

But finding only senders,  
and no receivers.

I've come so fucking far,  
from the weeping angel,  
stuck in alabaster, and I'm  
praying that I can barely manage  
to only by a day outlast her.

And the scrawlings on my arm,  
see their sun eclipsed, not fully,  
but in part, with not only these hands of your's,  
but the pictures in my mind of what they  
might have looked like before.

But I can't seem to mind,  
as if I would ever care,  
I'd reclaim your housekeys,  
but Ambers's coming back and in  
need to make a spare.
