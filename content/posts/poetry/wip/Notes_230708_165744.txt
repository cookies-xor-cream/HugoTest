My Heart Probably Got Held Back A Couple Grades

I swear if my head could call the shots,  
This would be a lot fucking easier,  
My heart is brash, chronically impatient,  
But my head knows when to be a people pleaser.

Please, sir, ma'am. Give me a moment in advance,  
So I can conjure motives to decline this dance,  
For I would rather cliffwalk than indulge in footwork,  
That's just how my venusian machinations work.

She's gorgeous, more than me, by miles,  
Smarter than me, and never learned to fight,  
What an idiot it must have taken,  
To let this mistake leave me so brazen.

You'd think in their presence gracing me,  
My heart would forgot any semblance of literacy,  
For infatuation and not disinterest,  
But the cardiac can't learn to self-invest.

Stephanie's run her mouth to the floor and back,  
With the frustration of haphazard verbal attacks,  
She tells me I can't be so fucking picky,  
"Just accept next time, they're all so fucking pretty".
