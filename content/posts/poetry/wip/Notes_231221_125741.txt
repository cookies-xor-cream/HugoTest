A Graph Of Everyone I Never Really Knew

This network's made of cliques and isolated little relationships,
But it feels like the turning point when each person I meet is no longer their own separate thing.

I pruned some branches but accidentally entwined some leaves,
The wood managed to grow out of the folliage, back down to the bark, to join at the base beneath.
