Time Is Watching Her Pick Up The Pace

Your eyes were duct-taped, plastered,
Strapped and fastened to the floor,
You asked me what I wanted and
I said I wanted anything but more.

If I could smash the clock, I would,
But I need aim and ammunition,
And I can't begin to comprehend,
Why I would and what it's even for.

You've passed the time just dodging stares,
As the timepiece on the wall ricocheted,
That sad look redirected cleanly back,
As a side-eyed glaring from its face.

The hands are drifting out of sync,
The small one, a fiftieth of the other's speed,
And I'm thinking on the implications,
Of how each hour sees a sixth of it concede.
