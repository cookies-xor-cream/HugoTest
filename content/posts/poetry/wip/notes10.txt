A Dishonest Attempt At Piloting A Motor Vehicle

She actually made the call today,  
But she was slurring still,  
You know that if my heart was a house,  
You'd find me straddling by the windowsill.

Because a reply of my acceptance,  
For her to buy me coffee,  
Was a date planned as a penance,  
And that's not enough for me.

I'd rather have handed you back your car keys,  
So you could finish what you started,  
Take a couple shots, return,  
If only to have killed me.

Or rather, killed yourself.
