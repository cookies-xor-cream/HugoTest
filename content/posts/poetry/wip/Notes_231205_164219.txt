Things Where Things Shouldn't Be?

Right after I ossified my joint, put my ankle out of work, I climbed a tower with a friend,
And no one told me the struggle of drawing sufficient breath through a facture worth of pain.
But I suppose by the third surgery the capacity that your lung has for a stamina gets clear,
Thankfully, my friend put breath into my lungs, gestured at venus to say "you can see the CBD from here".
