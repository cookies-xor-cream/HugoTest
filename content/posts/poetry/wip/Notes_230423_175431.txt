Act Four: Being Monologued At

I got a call and peeked the extension,
it was too early there for drinking,
but I was betting against retention,
please don't remember this call,
please try not to pay attention.

There was a moment between the ringing,
where I had a doubt that I should be
picking up my phone,
that I shouldn't be answering this tone.
that I should just let it ring,
and make my way, quietly back home.

But curiosity beat me out,
dug the remnants of this body,
from six feet out the ground.

I got questions in a maelstrom,
like a fusillade of blades.
It felt like less like a call,
and felt more like a raid.

And if I eat all the knives,
then I guess I might survive.
It'll grind out the whinstone,
and she'll chip off the block.

And so I made my way back whilist
she said something like "I missed her",
the words wouldn't break through the crying,
but by the timbre of her voice,
I could feel the blunted sentiment
that somebody had hurt her,
or something in that vein I suppose.
