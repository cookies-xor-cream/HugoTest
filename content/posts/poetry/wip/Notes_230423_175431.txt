Act Four: Being Monologued At

Hannah Had A Dream And Amber Was Enabling Her

So happy I don't get this stupid shit anymore.

I got a call and peeked the extension,
It was too early there for drinking,
But I was betting against retention,
Please don't remember this call,
Please try not to pay attention.

There was a moment between the ringing,
Where I had a doubt that I should be
Picking up my phone,
That I shouldn't be answering this tone.
That I should just let it ring,
And make my way, quietly back home.

But curiosity beat me out,
Dug the remnants of this body,
From six feet out the ground.

I got questions in a maelstrom,
Like a fusillade of blades.

That felt like less like a call,
And felt more like a raid.

And if I eat all the knives,
Then I guess I might survive.

Itll grind out the whinstones,
And she'll chip off her bones.

And so I made my way back while
She said something like "I missed her",
The words wouldn't break through the crying,
But by the timbre of her voice,
I could feel the blunted sentiment
That somebody had hurt her, I suppose.
