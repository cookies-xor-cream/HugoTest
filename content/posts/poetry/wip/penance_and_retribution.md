I just want to preface this with a solemn hope that hell exists,
For I'd forget but can't forgive, there's no cause for ten whole years of this.

I saw a black blossom creeping under shirt, as if brought alive by summon,
So I made a misnomer of her button-up, better now called by the name 'ubuttoned',
And in the hallway, halfway through her bleary teary-eyed quasiconvalescence
We found a sleepless angel gracing us with her eldritch placid prescence,
Sneaking behind as if the omnipresent.

The seraph glared down with her hundred eyes, onto this crime scene of a sight,
And I felt her wrath pass me through, as her gift of violence unwrapped for you.
And little Olive, beneath my hands, rationalised why her skin's not intact,
Saving me from a divine miscarriage of a sudden-fade-to-black by way of saccades,
From the heaven's will to splice and bifrucate.

The celestial thing stood in a stellar daze, nebulas in orbit around her face,
And locked me with those sunbeamed eyes, burned me through till dead inside,
Or at least enough to pay her mind, that she isn't his, and she never was,
But I could never call her mine for that would cross a cosmic line.

To touch, to see, to bite, to breathe. She urged me restraint for all these things,
And I did for she is biblical, and I'd so hate for hell to disturb my little precious peace.
I made my distance, Olive made her shirt clad skin, to hide those darkened sickly spills,
Though hidden they were still on site, burned on the retinas behind my eyes.

Woman, if we had the contact in our phones, we'd call God here to let him know,
To smite down your husband in his home,
Through the tiles, and through the floor,
Far past the mantle, and to the core.
Whatever fate, it's not enough,

Whatever wrought's no just demise.
For these markers you wear,
The bruises of his alleged 'love'
Has no justice served, no hell enough,
No penance payed, no time enough.

Hell: short, or long, or forever,
Even death's nevermore can't tear this jury asunder.
One death, or a hundred, we're sorely short of penance or punishment.
