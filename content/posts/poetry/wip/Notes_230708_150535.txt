Xeno Applies To Cupid, But Not Azrael

I wish the reaper took his 15 minute OSHA mandated water break,
But who are we so stern in our demands, so stubborn in for what we ask,
Killing death can't be a next week's Thursday pass time,
We need Xeno coz it's a god damn supertask, the thing we're requesting.

"I don't want my death to be painless,
Just quick enough that the torture
Don't get a second chance to sink in".
