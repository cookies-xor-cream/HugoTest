I don't like the verbiage  
Of calling me jaded,  
It's the third time this week,  
And I'm starting to dissolve.

I'm misplaced baggage,  
Faded from memory,  
Once it has been mislabelled,  
It sits in wait to be discarded.

I prefer the adage that  
The death are free but  
The waiting all are  
Existence-addled.

I'm missing the equipment,  
Paraphernalia to meet her,  
But I'll buy a rope and a
Step-stool or a ladder later.
