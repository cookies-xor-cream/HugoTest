I've got a  
Rope and  
An anchor,  
But you're  
Seaside, and  
Stranded.  
So tell me  
Did you  
Wear your  
Seatbelt when  
You landed?

And Lisbon  
Is far,  
But we need  
The distance  
Between.  
If life is a joke  
You're the  
Punchline  
To my teens.

You're in waste  
And decay.  
And I knew  
That you'd say  
That we'd make  
It on out  
But you're still  
At this start  
With this hole  
In your heart.  
And it's paired  
With the wall,  
That I will  
Wash up  
When you finally  
Decide to  
Throw it all up.

And there's  
No boy that  
Can fill  
The place  
Of that girl.  
They're painting  
Your collar  
Like you're still  
In your twenties  
And scared.  
But the marks  
Have by now  
All faded away.  
I've left the  
Decade behind,  
Don't try to  
Convince me to stay.  
We've finished  
This game  
So why do you  
Keep insisting  
We play?
