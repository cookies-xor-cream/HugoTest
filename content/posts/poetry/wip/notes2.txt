The World Is A Hypoxic Place When I Share It With You

You're oxygen deprevation in the forest.
You're the decision to breathe underwater.
You're self-performed surgery in the backyard garden,
You're the bottle of whatsitsname that helped me through it.

You're every muscle fibre I saw cut out.
You're the amnesia that made sterilising that knife
Slip my fucking mind.

And now I'm playing a boardgame with you,
In the middle of the night, in the middle of a park.
I suppose that's what funerals do to families.
Because whatever you are, you're always family.

Not by ancestry, our bloodwork will forever mismatch,
But we've a shared nest from which both of us hatched.
Not my sister by blood, not my sister in soul,
But you're my sister in time, and it's getting old.

So wash the sorority forever stuck in my eyes,
And stop asking your stupid questions,
I think given the option of your company,
I'd rather see myself sequestered.
