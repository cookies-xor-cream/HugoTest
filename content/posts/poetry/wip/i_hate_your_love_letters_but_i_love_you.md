Y'know that 'twixt the infinite entrapment of this Seoul apartment's encasement,
I'm sitting at the lattice, stuck staring with gaze galling, galeing to the pavement,
I'm a stranger in these walls, an alien dressed as a ghost down winding halls,
Sans you, I've the estrangement of a serial killer's basement: the only curse that I can host,
A mumbling of my finite love come from an empty space,
Come from the empty haunting of an empty ghost.

I'm not a banana, or a white girl,
Or a lumberjack without a forest,
Please disregard my red and checkered jacket,
Please ignore our tasteless matching flannel,
I'm an alien passed as the blood-curdling of a ghost,
Watching from a distant land, as you unravel and unfurl:
You're a sponge but dissolve and can't ever absorb.
