With my face then rinsed out red, I had my two bloodshot eyes,  
The day went slower than what I would have ever thought,  
I suppose that I should have rehearsed my words to you, or god,  
But it makes my heartbeat stop and sit quietly in its place.

(Or maybe sometimes run right off,  
Race off to some ethereal run-down,  
Derelict palace of a barely  
Superliminal, barely vacant space).

My dad held up my departure,  
I was stranded with his guest,  
My mind's not yet off your funeral,  
But I've got an assignments, I've got tests.

She's been sentimental since you died,  
And I've been a little dead inside to be so frank,  
God, I detest the meaningless transaction  
Of exchanging condolences to get thanks.

Looks like I can't get this shit done right.  
With the exception of if you might write  
The gemstone onto that list, but she's less a task,  
And more a pain that haunts my right hand and my wrist.

So every reluctant time I check my phone,  
To a hundred one-off midnight calls I missed,  
I think of you, then swipe her upwards off the screen.  
I'll die inside spontaneously, and manifest  
The falsehood that we have never shared a kiss.

(And I know...  
She's also sorry that there's more,  
But nothing after that first brush  
Of the kick-off kiss had any fucking  
Sentiment, it's only empty touch).

And I know...  
If she had read this prayer,  
That I wrote on her behalf,  
She'd tell you:  
"Euphie, read half the thing,  
And Ignore the other half".
