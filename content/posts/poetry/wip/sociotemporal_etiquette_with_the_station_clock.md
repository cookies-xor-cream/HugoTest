The two hands fixed upon the clock,  
Seem to cross and wave at me,  
From the panel above the place  
The time is written on an LCD.

As if every minute that I spent,  
In idle wait for missing trains,  
Is another minute that I waste,  
Saying hello to missed regrets.

I regret so much I left behind,  
Somewhere on the schedule,  
And I missed so many opportunities,  
Sitting, staring at the clock.

It would be nice to live with more mistakes,  
But I keep wasting time just waving back,  
To a redundant analogue device,  
As a politeness betwixt panic attacks
