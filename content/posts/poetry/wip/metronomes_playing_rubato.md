She's got the cutest little stim where she spells out 'save my soul' in morse,  
It reminds me of the winter drumming on my window with all its frozen force,  
Played likely by the weather, but possibly instead by a choir full of ghosts.  
You can hear the tachycardia in her fingers as they tap a dimineundo of a trill,  
She can do almost anything, except for sit perfectly silent and perfectly still.

She's defiant in smiling, despite her little sleep, like a blaring alarm,  
Till she falls under the weather, back to the normal baseline level of calm.  
But she's played over by rain, like a bomb in disguise as she quietly arms,  
You can call her discordant like wind, you can call her barely intact,  
But if she were a tempest, I would fucking love a barometric attack.
