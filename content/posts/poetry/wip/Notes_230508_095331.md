The Chemistry Of A Crash Landing: Homogenous Exothermia  
I'd like to see the albatross hit mach one,  
I'm waiting for some severe weather,  
To turn it to a falling fragment of our sun.  
The ocean wind billows underwing,  
A bird like a plane, that's only short  
The hum of the engine as it sings.  
A silent glide into an endless night,  
In avoidance of the day, fir the wings  
That hold it up are so susceptible to light.  
We don't need a retelling of Icarus,  
Of the sun, and of the seafoam steam,  
They only make the plumage tan and bream.  
Like a nautilus granted smoother motion,  
Overhead in the turbulence and the  
Bayside's aqueous propulsion.  
If you crank up the thermostat,  
You'll see the bird go azeatropic,  
In the form of a shooting star,  
That found its final landing starting,  
And soon it'll see that come to pass.
