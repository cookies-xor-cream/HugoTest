I post too much, and too much of it
Is way too close to fluff, I think,
Like Easter eggs of a life I lived;
I wonder if she ever took a crack at it.

If it can be done, then by her it will,
She'll stitch these tiny moving stills,
Like pictures strewn to make a film,
Like subtext surfaced down deep within.

She could see my bark be stripped from me,
Could peel her eyes behind the surface sheen,
She could peek the rings that lie within,
She could count off each and every thing --

Find every tale and fable lived,
Tick the boxes, cross the t's
Off every stale remark I bid,
And bid farewell, and grant adieu,
To part with words of wisdom found:
"It starts with her and ends with you,
Where you are bound, I am rebound
Sans you".
