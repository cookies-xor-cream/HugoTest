There'a thing I feel helplessly  
And violently till the end,  
So I still feel the way I did,  
But now I need you out my view.

Every feeling that I catch,  
Seems to infinitely last,  
So despite what's in my heart,  
This dislike will never come to pass.

The hate like a disease,  
Is spreading from you to me,  
Just this time now,  
Love won't put it at ease.
