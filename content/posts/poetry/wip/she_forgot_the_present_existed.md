You live everything after the fact,  
Premeditating responses along with panic attacks.

Your friends are afraid of their words,  
That must be what happens when you treat them like dirt.

You're either bursting at the seams with life,  
Or an empty shell craving tomorrow's ghost since yesternight.

Any tense except the present  
Is a hypothesis of anachronism,  
Some fabled bit of tragedy,  
A glimpse into your yesteryear for me.

And if you took the time to really look, you'd see.  
If you're living with the future, it'd be happier sans me.
