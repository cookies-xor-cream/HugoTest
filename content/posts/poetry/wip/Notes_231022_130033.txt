Biteforce And Blindness

Heaven's path runs in this double-visioned facade found squarely between these tired eyes of mine. And I'm not sure that this lust would quit if we acquiesced the light.

You left me with a bite but should've left me with a mark. I feel like I got slut shamed again, at least a little bit. I may as well have gotten something to show or wear for it.
