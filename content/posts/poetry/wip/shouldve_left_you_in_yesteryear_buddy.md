Well, if I see the blonde tomorrow, I'm stabbing out my eyes,  
I can't peel them off the lustre of her lenses,  
The way the sunlight swims around, spiraling downwards inside.

The deadpan look she always wears,  
Like she's constantly anxious but never scared,  
The smile underpinning the remarks that I'd never dare to pick a fight.

It's not for fear, I swear the lack thereof advance  
Is always made of apprehension,  
You look lonely, but don't have idle hands.

And I don't think I'll be bored enough tomorrow,  
Not to fill something that isn't empty,  
Sweetheart there's no patching this,  
There's nothing left but vacancies in me.
