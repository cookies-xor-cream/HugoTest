All Grass Is Equally Green When The Sun Is Far Enough Away

My battery's flat, I've no track of the time,
But you're getting anxious, I hope that's not a sign,
Don't do anything dumb, for I'm out of advice,
This field is all tinder, and I can't put out the fire.

Your eyes dart and wander, dodging the blood,
Looking for something green to rivet them on,
But dawnbreak is far, and the grass is asleep,
We're gonna leave before the onslaught of avian screams.

Don't wake up the birds, please tread light in the park,
Else this wake of black buzzards will pick at your heart.
