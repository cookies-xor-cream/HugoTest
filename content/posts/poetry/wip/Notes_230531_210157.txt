Wherefore Art Thou?
I've Been Better, But Been Worse, Thanks For Asking

She swapped languages,
I suppose coz we had company,
And she didn't wanna say it
In a language that they speak?

"Are you happy?"

And the honest answer
Would be maybe that I think so?
But why else would I be
Over at yours on Tuesday and past midnight?

So I cast away that thought 
And said that "even if I wasn't,
It wouldn't be attributed to you,
Of that fact I'm wholely sure".

Her response was "I read everything.
Why do you sugarcoat our interactions?
Just write plainly what I've done.
Just detail all of my infractions".

I hate that. I can't and won't use that word.
Had we been under different circumstance,
I'm sure I wouldn't be so unreceptive,
Find this confrontingly pervasive.

Guess I'm stuck now, a child possessed,
Dreaming that instead you might have said:
"It's nice to know that I'm not
The blade in the back of your hand,
That keeps your palm from contact,
And forces your wrists to contract.

But if I was, I would match your grip,
Take the brunt out of the lockjaw,
Pry the toothache open as the
Fluorine loses foothold, and comes to slip.

You're not in that deep, dear denizen of this twilight bench,
The war starts when the fighting ends inside the trench.
That's when memory seeps into every crevice,
So pray tell to me whereat the shellshock is".
