"Life is a short dull buzz,  
let me sharpen mine on you,  
it'll be the last mission you fly,  
although we both know that isn't true".

Read this hand and weep,  
we'll give the willow loam and silt,  
and give him the best view  
from a gravel laden courtside seat.

Our match drew out at  
9pm at your place every night,  
it was a four hour walk each way,  
I loved the stroll, but the timing was too tight.

I missed so much sleep,  
was sedated both ways home,  
but the nightmare let loose
wrote better than I ever could.

This was a picture book,  
a collection of perfect tiny stills,  
with a vague suggestion of a story,  
that you would never fill.
