I'm in the oven, catching heat,  
But it's far too cold for fire,  
Even at 180 fan-forced degrees.

Cremate me when I'm gone,  
And use the scraps for lunch,  
I think I'd make a halfway decent broth.

She's got a pan, she's got a sinker and a hook,  
She's just short a seafood barrel,  
At which her words could maybe shoot.

For she has stones, and sticks  
And a thousand other wonderful  
Marrow-disintegrating things.

She's got the will to hold the pause,  
Long past the death of the demon  
At the end of each dependent clause.

But for everything its worth,  
My lady misplaced her purse,  
And she arrived to bid,  
And so she can be bought.

Her heart comes with  
A gift-bag and receipt.  
Her mind comes with  
Doublethink and conceit.
