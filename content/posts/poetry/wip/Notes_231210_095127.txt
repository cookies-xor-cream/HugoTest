The Archaeopteryx's Palaephilie

I'm in love with a ghost and we know how that goes,  
I'm living possessed, with a stranger stuck in my chest,  
And you told me to chase, but I doubt that's what's best,  
I'll leave your carcass to rot, left inside of this pause,  
A silence that struck, leaving a carapaced pose,  
A fossilised prose, wearing a skin that is missing its core.

Your viscera and feathers washed in the crests of the clock,  
I dug up the site but think I assembled you wrong,  
You're laid bare like a bait, on a hook that's stuck on a snare,  
And I bit with my hand, a drawn out ten digit demand,  
I got your number, but no data as to where we might stand.

So my petra in ice, my quintuplet of spice,  
My rock given wings, my osseous thing,  
A culture shock of a time and a place far away,  
Tell me, brittle-boned bird, should I dig up your grave?
