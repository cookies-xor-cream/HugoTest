I need the railing for my balance,  
But I need to fall to understand,  
Reason's arrested my stance,  
And I've lost the grip inside my hands.

Give me a balance beam,  
I'd rather fly than struggle,  
And however my thoughts read,  
They're not written in rebuttal.

We had a church now we have rubble,  
Started a religion so we could boil the trouble,  
But it only ever wants to simmer,  
To slowly cook away these sinners,  
In their own alligator tears.
