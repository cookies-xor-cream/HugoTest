I told myself if it took alcoholism for you not to do anything stupud when you were drunk around me, that was a fair fucking price.

"Be careful what you wish for", for I'd have never thought how wrong I was. I want my friend back.

I thought you read enough history books to know better than isolationism,
But I guess that was an assumption based in a baseless optimism.

I like you better than who you were last year.
Every touch is a graze of truthful mistake,
Some slur of fine-motor miscoordination.

I like it better than what you did yesteryear.
Than that stupid fucking sinking feeling,
That nagging dialogue rambling asking
How the fuck I was supposed to tell her.
