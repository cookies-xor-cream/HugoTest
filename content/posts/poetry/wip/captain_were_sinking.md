If I could kill what's left of us, of you,  
And make space for the rest of me,  
I would stab out every crevice,  
I'd cast the trimmings to the sea.

Thrown violently into water,  
Not to float upon a ship on fire.  
But to sink as dregs down to the bottom.  
You asked what 'we are',  
Might I suggest:  
We're confused, fetid, rotten, and maybe cursed.

Could you please be done with me?  
I know that I am done with you.

We could make this thing mutual  
If only you felt the same thing too.
