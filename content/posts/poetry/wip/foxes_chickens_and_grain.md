I know that the two of us agreed we'd cross this bridge when you arrived in this god forsaken place,  
But I don't have the resolve or the fortitude to keep this feeling trapped infinitely inside of my empty chest.

I'm hollowed out, still hoping for anything except for an encore of what we had the time before.  
Why is it, dearest, that when there's wine here in play the less we ask for, the more we seem to give and take?

Can the two of us not be spiralled and together, just close enough to fall in tandem but never touch?  
That's all I ask for, and nothing more. So why does it feel like to ask for less is me asking far too much?
