It Had To Be My Fault, Blaming The Dead Girl She Was Hung Up On Was Too Grim A Prospect

I was sat on her bed, a willing hostage,
gift-wrapped in arms that weren't mine,
Pari knocked, walked through the door,
stared at us and spoke our tagline.

With a broken sigh a phrase ejected:
*"Oh my dear, pray where is the harm?",*
I couldn't look away from my captor,
but I uttered, "never here, and never now".

I was met with the intelligence,
abundantly mistimed, and tragically misplaced,
that they broke up by cause of I,
while the sun peeked through, dancing on her face.

*"I hate the way she looks at you,*
*I want that look, she knows I do,*
*She liked me too, but your friendship*
*Is just love wearing a guise,*
*I wish that I was the sole captor of her eyes".*

I wasn't quite sure how to riposte,
so I detangled her arms and left my post,
"Sweet sentinel, is the proof we're platonic,
not strong enough in the fact that she is gay?
what more is there we possibly could say?".

*"She's your motive to live, and*
*you are requited too as her's,*
*so tell me, dear, how I'd love someone,*
*whose heart lacks vacant space?".*

"Pari", I spotted the bouquet,
"Her affection isn't salvation,
You brought her flowers for Kat's grave,
And booked out all her reservations.
If you wanted her heart,
And for it to be exclusively reserved,
I'd leave her be, but tell me frankly,
Is that what she deserves?".
