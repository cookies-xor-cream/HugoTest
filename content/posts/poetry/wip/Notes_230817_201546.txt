Earthquakes In The Sky, Earthquakes In The Ocean

You found the same umbrage
In the points of my remarks,
That is found underwing,
In the cast of you flood in dark.

A feathered wreckage of an
Icarean crashlanded plumage,
And flightless-addled sutures,
In the sun or the bottom of the ocean.

I will name you my dearest fondant,
Though you're not sweet,
For you're the bottomed silver lining
To this siphon of a throne-side seat.

Don't address me by my title,
And I will reciprocate the favour,
My saccharine queen of nothing,
Ruling with such flightless fervour.

If I didn't have to, I swear to Helios,
I wouldn't've plucked your feathers,
Maybe then you could escape,
These oceanic tremors.
