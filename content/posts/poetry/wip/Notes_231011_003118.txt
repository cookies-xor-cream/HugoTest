Your Ineptitude For Maintaining Distance Is Such A Poor Remedy For Your Loneliness

If I could kill what's left of us, of you,
And make space for the rest of me,
I would stab out every crevice,
I'd cast the trimmings to the sea.

Thrown violently into water,
Not to float upon a ship on fire.
But to sink as dregs down to the bottom.
You asked what 'we are',
Might I suggest:
We're confused, fetid, rotten, maybe cursed.

Could you please be done with me?
I know that I am done with you.
