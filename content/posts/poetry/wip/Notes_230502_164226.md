"It's like you're addicted to contact transmission,  
And everyone you touch feels a paroxysm of remission",  
'The outbreak of a sudden wellness,  
Like the root disease still can fester'.  
"All who brush you lose their essence",  
'I'm not The Collector, it's just my presence',  
"Sounds like words not spoken by The Collected",  
'If I've collected you, divine me, please, how you are afflicted?'.  
"I used to think, have original thought,  
But the idea of you had my stores bought dry",  
'I never asked for obsession, never planned on it,  
This trial is judgement passed by your own hand,  
So own it and  
Reflect on where we stand'.
