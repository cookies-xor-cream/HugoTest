"Friends Don't Datamine Friends"

To be told without being told at all.  
The stutter on her lips is evidence plenty of it all.

You told me about her dying ask.  
When I exchanged my own first-hand,  
You assumed the request had symmetry,  
So unprivy to my hidden telemetry.

I made a request, put a transaction in play,  
And I'll know the answer by whether you reply 'okay'.  
This is a trapping of an olive-branch extension,  
And I'm catching you in this network's tension.

If you say 'no', I know the answer's 'yes',  
And if you accept, then you must profess.  
So unless your denial comes in double fold,  
The answer's clearly been already told.

I'm sorry I had to enact this gambit,  
I just needed to see it through, you know,  
Didn't want to share my hand, so I did it through  
The implication of a zero-knowledge proof.
