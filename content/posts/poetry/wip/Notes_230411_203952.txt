Anxious Contractions (Haven't Got Them In Over A Month)

She found a wrinkle in time, and made it a crease,
I'll let go of my grip, and with the pressure released,
You can see the black paint streak on her arms,
Like the markings of a voluntary, external self-harm.

She insisted that she must share in my pain,
But I insisted that that need makes her insane,
If you want to feel what I do in this state,
Then cut off your tongue, and wire your jaw,
Then bask in the taste.

I think open letters are a stupid format if I'm being perfectly honest. But I also kind of love them in a way.

I don't think I ever said thanks, only apologised for it, so now I'm saying thanks about 6 years too late.

Thanks for making the contractions a little easier, even if you knew it would hurt you.

Thanks for ignoring me calling you an idiot for doing it at your expense.

Thanks for letting me fracture your wrist.
