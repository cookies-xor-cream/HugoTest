Beating Suicidal Ideation

I've been thinking about the difference  
Between depression and a certain ideation,  
I don't like to be told from what I suffer,  
So let me raise Azrael this final offer.

At any given time, I can't be affording to die,  
I've got a repeating plan, set a weekend ahead,  
And if I make it to then, I'll reschedule the date,  
And you'll find me alive, I can't meet if I'm dead.

If I make it to morning then I'll hold that as proof,  
That I'm compulsively counting to 60,  
And thankful for fact that time's got no roof,  
And if no other struggle, then time will have fixed me.

For every time her hands touched anything of mine,  
The second hand brushed me twofold the time.

I'm living at double the count in double-time,  
and I've all but lost the counter,  
let's restart this increment back at 'one'.
