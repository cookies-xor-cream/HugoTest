Smile Like A Sunbeam From The Frostborne

Fuck your worth in gold, I want your weight in solvents. So since you're ice could we melt you down to liquid H2O?  
I swear to god there's ionic phosphorus in my bones, for when your smile lights up my marrow begins to glow.

I would accept any fucking thing except for being left here to sparkle on my own,  
After all, phosphors don't come in isolation, they're found in pairs and not alone.
