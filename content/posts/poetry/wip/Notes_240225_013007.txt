You asked for writing and I guess I live only to please or perhaps I just please to survive,
You said I should try my hand at a song, but this stringing slur of a verse will have to suffice.

I promised her sleep, to shut locked my eyes, but the roof of my room is too sore of a sight,
So I guess I should count the sheep as they pass, as they venture between each of my
Too dense-packed tribute-collage of my montaged highschool panic attacks.

So I'll head back inside, run the washing machines, in avoidance of all of my anxiety.
Pretending away to squish and dismay the backbeat tremor of this heart with its pulse in decay.
