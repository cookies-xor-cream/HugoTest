Aschismia

Every fleeting feeling's filling my leaking bucket of a heart,
On the subject of a love that's never enough,
And I'd buy more but my wallet's all I brought,
And I need my gullet to tolerate another bottle of this stuff.

So tell me, words or telepathy, why's all I feel this apathy,
I've so much haste to see my eyes go wide and swallow
The disguise you try to hide behind, to pry it off of you,
To let the muscle tissue spew and bleed anaemia out of truth.

Honesty's not so ferrous, and as such it has deferred us,
But dethroned, defanged, or defeathered,
This is the last storm that I can weather,
Whether or not we see this tie then severed.

We thought we were so clever,
but the only time we were was 'never'.
