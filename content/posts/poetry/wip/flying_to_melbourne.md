I saw you before your out-bound flight,  
You were acting crazy in the car,  
Sitting in but not truly confined  
To your post made on the passenger side.

You asked way too many questions  
To which you couldn't take replies.  
I suppose that you never knew  
Your sister was pregnant when she died.

It wasn't my place to tell you anything,  
That girl would kill me if she still had hands,  
But I suppose when one's dead and buried,  
Homicide is just barely out of grasp.

I told you to just let the past be buried,  
But you keep wondering if she ever told the dad.
