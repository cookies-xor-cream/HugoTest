Xeno's Paradox But Applied To Python

If I read or write
Another line of code,
I'll disassemble,
Fucking fall apart.

I don't think that
I was built to work,
Why else would it
Fucking hurt.

It's easier with
You on a call,
I would stumble but
I'd never fall.

I'm starting to think
Expiration's overdue,
Coz my git commits
Tell a story of
A funeral spent sans you.
