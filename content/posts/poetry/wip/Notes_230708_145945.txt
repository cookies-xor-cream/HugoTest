Xeno's Paradox But Applied To Python

If I read or write  
another line of code,  
I'll disassemble,  
fucking fall apart.

I don't think that  
I was built to work,  
why else would it  
fucking hurt.

It's easier with  
you on a call,  
I would stumble,  
but I'd never fall.

I'm starting to think  
expiration's overdue,  
coz my git commits  
tell a story of  
a funeral spent sans you.
