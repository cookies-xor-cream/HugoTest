Gorgonification And Branding: The Two Opposite Punishments

I was weighted to the seat
Where she found herself on top of me,
It's a cosy sixteen degrees,
But she refused to beat this rabid heat.

I called her name, I spent my voice,
But she was seated, she was firmly poised,
Enacting something more morose,
Abandoning vestiges of her remorse.

If it is truly Medusa's curse
To have a den of snakes for hair,
They wouldn't pain with sullen glares,
It isn't corrective, it isn't fair.

So I'll bruise her collar,
Burn her hair,
I'll sink my teeth,
Feel her flesh tear.

I hope it hurts,
I never cared,
But it'll never hurt,
Unless you care.
