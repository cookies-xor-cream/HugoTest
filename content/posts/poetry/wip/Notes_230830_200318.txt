Everyone Talks About Not Shooting The Messenger, But It's The Messenger That Shot Me

Stephanie walked up to the bench,
Pointed out I couldn't see the moon,
She asked me why the good die young,
I told her that we all depart too soon.

I said there's always tomorrow,
There's always something more to do.
But in my heart I knew it true,
That there could only be so few.

She tried clearing out her throat,
Tried to tuck away her cough,
But carried a cigarette graveyard,
In the shape of black and battered lungs.

She then ruminated phlegm,
Between breaths she couldn't start,
Her title should be our warden,
Because we sat stuck locking eyes.

And the whole time I had known,
I was due for a goodbye,
So why did I then feel,
Like an unlit neon sign.

I thought that I had time.
I thought that it would turn out fine,
But the fuse burnt out inside of me
When she mustered "yeah, she died".
