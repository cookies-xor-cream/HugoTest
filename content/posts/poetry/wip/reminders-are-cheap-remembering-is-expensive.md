Je peux pas me souvenir

I was like you right down to the letter,  
liked drawings over pictures better,  
but the illustrations outside one's head,   
bleed out the lead until they're dead.

I was like you right down to the thinking,  
I sold snake oil only I was drinking,  
if something's missing, you can't draw it real,  
her portrait close won't keep her here.

I was like you right down to the stutter,  
hated moths, and to watch the desperate flutter,  
for the light that absorbs those vermin kin  
had caught my eyes and reeled me in.

I was like you right down to the measure,  
I was glued to lux, was bound and tethered,  
but for all the sunburn that my eyes ate,  
the light was a treasure I couldn't hate.

The sun and page are deeply hurt,  
by a breakup that was never curt,  
involved throwing things, projectile motion,  
sunrays flying in grave commotion.

Eventually the paper browned,  
and grew too weak for one more dawn,  
all the markings washed off the page,  
to wipe the slate, and clear the stage.

The rain to follow was a silent one,  
paper's frail, without legs to run,  
so it watched the clouds soaking it,  
without the flame to fight, it took the hits.

Eventually the paper drowned,  
and grew too weak for songbirds' songs,  
it lived for long but will have much regret,  
that it never caught fire towards the end.
