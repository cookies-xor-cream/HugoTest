It takes so much for me to fall,
but traffic makes for good ballistics,
gives my soul the power needed,
to frame itself outside logistics.

My friend just missed the scene,
when she asked me, "are you drunk?",
and so I gave it my very best,
to convince her that she's wrong.

Coz I'm looking for a daemon,
but she seems to me a dog,
that's not an insult in intent,
but a purpose that I robbed.

And if I meet her up in heaven,
and she told me she was god,
I wouldn't be the least surprised,
to see her with a sceptre or a rod.

Coz she pulled me out the path,
as the headlight high-beams
stained my vision black.
so I looked her in the eye,
and I told her what she lacked
was the general countenance
befitting of a cat.
