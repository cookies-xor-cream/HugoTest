Backtracking Exponential Decay
Powers Of A Half, Half Of Us Half Had The Power

The orchid was in bloom,
Through an eightball ket,
And a quarter filled balloon,
Weighing down half a heavy heart,
For the single one of us
That wished he were apart.

Our exponent equalled zero,
Is my goal and final mark.
