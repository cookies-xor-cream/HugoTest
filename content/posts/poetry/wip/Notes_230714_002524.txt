Life'sAHelluvaDrug

I woke up with a different config than what I went to sleep with,
Not that I did any sleeping to begin with.
But I must've blinked just twice or so,
Coz when I came to the big red button in my head,
It sparked to life and began to glow.

I suppose seeing the date flip over
Put my mind at war with lucid and with sober,
How the fuck does the world still turn,
Please refund my will to fantasise,
Dream this world away, to watch it burning at my cue.

I wanted her out of my head, why the fuck'd my brain
Go and swap the vacancies of her on out for you?

A fantasic afantasia, and dreamless ataraxia,
Were both clinically replaced, whilst sporadically deferred,
Mailed into a ravine by way of courier pigeon,
Lacking the option for to the sender be returned.

The bird became a comet, he's shooting down a trench,
If I wanted here this feeling, I'd muster it back up at that bench,
I'm halfway stuck between your voicemail and an earworm of a dirge,
I didn't need to dream this lust up in these deluges,
I need to chew some willow's bark instead of birch.

I just need this off my chest.
Can you please take this off my chest?
What the fuck do you mean by I'm in pain,
Just fucking trust me, between us two
I think I know myself the best.
