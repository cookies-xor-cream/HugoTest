I Wasted My Childhood At Her House Playing Games Which Needed Two Computers

Fuck first blood, she not only drew it,
But she got a penta in succession,
I need some hyperlinear regression,
To leave residuals as payment and concession.

For how she got her ducks in a row,
And shot them down in a mallard rain,
In a skybirthed fusillade of the mana
That she so reluctantly had to spend.

I'm a roguelike but she missed the resemblance,
As if the luminance hit her into the light,
Reclaimed the cash on the skins she spent,
So she could die in style on Sunday nights.

Do you really need to be born to die,
Or is the spawnkill evidence enough,
Of this fountaincamping 1v9: like a
Sanguine nimbus altar stamped into the sky.

Oh god it has been a while,
Is is sad how young I peaked?
It takes an abundance of free time
To beat s3 in a 1v1.

But he wouldn't even
Remember the loss to me.
Is there noise there in the forest
If a felling goes unseen?

Or are we both living,
In the legacy hotkeys
Of a long-forgotten fever dream?
