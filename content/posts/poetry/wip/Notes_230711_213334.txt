Fixing What Doesn't Need Fixing

Don't know if I'll fall asleep at all,  
or pass out easier than I have all year,  
I'm staring down my calendar events,  
like it'll make this Thursday disappear.

I feel like I may be retro- and not pro- active,  
as if I've been living badly in advance,  
It's like washing off the red before  
any of us have bloodied any hands.

I'll trade absolution for dissolution,  
that's my final resolution.  
I'll trade penance for consecration,  
swap my patience for desecration.

For impatience, more crushing than nullity,  
is void in substance, void in duration,  
it's the vacant words of our amendment  
to this non-existent constitution.
