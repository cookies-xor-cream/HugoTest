Stephanie, had I my own remote,
I'd turn off this stupid show.
I can't watch you staring at
This motion picture made of snow.

I am noise that albanesces,
Into a shitty grain of static film,
Like confused moir√© interference
Streaming across the TV screen.

I'm a pop up prompt in the bottom left,
That you're not on the right frequency,
I'm sure there's a more fitting program,
Maybe change the channel and we'll see?
