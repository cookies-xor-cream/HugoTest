I Didn't Visit Coz I'm Busy, Why Would You Catch Me On My Walk? I Don't Need Some Second Coming, To Help The Orchid's Dying Stalk  
And Thrice For Thrice, None The Less?  
I Need A Translation For 'Magar',  
It's Not 'Unless'  
The only greeting that was left in me  
Was "happy mother's day my sweetie",  
She asked how I could call her that,  
After my preoccupation ran.  
And she knows the answer,  
It's spreading like a cancer,  
But you're more like a canker sore,  
That I miss but never bargained for.  
Coz I always get a taste for blood,  
For the rupture running towards my lungs,  
Once you drown, you know you've lived,  
And I'd let you know too, but I'm short a shiv.  
Not that I would stab you here,  
The most I'll do is dam my tears,  
To suffer with me don't count as penance,  
You'll sit here alone, soaked in suspense,  
In dismal dreaming,  
Held by tree nymphs,  
Strung by torsion  
To keep retention  
As you pense.
