I gave her the rundown when she called me,  
because as deep as the history runs, she gives the best advice,  
she told me "fuck it, go crash and burn,  
and if you don't, you'll still skid off the road,  
but what's the alternate approach?  
You don't ever do as you've been told".

She told me that when I hit my head my wires crossed,  
that a timeline where I went unscathed was a timeline  
where she suffer twice the same tragic loss.

She told me that I'm nothing if not unfiltered,  
she told me that there's no alternative for me,  
no second option, that I can hide,  
and hold out till the winter.

She said that in a different history,  
she was waiting with the crowbar method prepared,  
that though they're convinced I knocked something loose,  
she has every faith they smashed it into place.
