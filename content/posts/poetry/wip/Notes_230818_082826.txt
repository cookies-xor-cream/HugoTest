The Telecommunications Doctor

I can't expunge the image in my head that
The hospital staff, towards the end,
Were playing switch-board operator,
With IV bags and your cannular.

I can't get that soundbite out my ears,
From when you said you wish that I were here,
That we'd hold an early open casket birthday party,
And you'd laugh as I tried to hold back tears.

Medical school must be easier than it seems,
Or less useful than it claims to be,
Because they couldn't stop the jammer
From disconnecting my friend from me.
