There's azimuth in the rift,  
stretched between your lips,  
your words stick to your tongue,  
in wait for your jaw, starkly to divide.

But they'll rot in wait inside,  
so I opt to read the paragraphs,  
all the stories I have missed,  
as they're inscribed into your eyes.

I want to sit in silence,  
to steep in speechless company,  
but I swear to god, you never learned  
how to shut yourself up in front of me.

Because I hate feeling any prescence,  
especially when unannounced,  
but I suppose that with all of you,  
it's something that I hadn't already found.
