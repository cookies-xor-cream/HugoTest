There's azimuth in the rift,  
Stretched between your lips,  
Your words stick to your tongue,  
In wait for your jaw, starkly to divide.

But they'll rot in wait inside,  
So I opt to read the paragraphs,  
All the stories I have missed,  
As they're inscribed into your eyes.

I want to sit in silence,  
To steep in speechless company,  
But I swear you never learned  
How to shut yourself up in front of me.

Because I hate feeling any prescence,  
Especially when unannounced,  
But I suppose that with all of you,  
It's something that I hadn't already found.
