Whenever Someone Asks Me That Question I Remember This Conversation

"You don't read for the amusement,
You're perusing for the art,
You think there's no substance in a book,
If it doesn't make you cry".

*"Let me tell you why, my dear,*
*If I wanted a story, I would live,*
*But I'm living out a cliché,*
*So I crave a different thing".*

"If this was a cliché then you would
Fucking sleep with me,
Coz there's nothing more atypical,
That the two of us could be".

I took a moment there to ponder that,
And power through the double-vision,
Take her in with the scenery, like
The portrait of a landscape in remission.

"This isn't a relationship, this is friendship+",
*"This is all that I can want with you, yet still borders on too much".*
