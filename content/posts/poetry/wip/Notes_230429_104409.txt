Whenever Someone Asks Me That Question I Remember This Conversation

"You dont read for the amusement,
Youre perusing for the art,
You think there's no substance in a book,
If it doesn't make you cry".

'Let me tell you why, my dear,
If I wanted a story, I would live,
But I'm living out a cliché,
So I crave a different thing'.

"If this was a cliché then you would
Fucking sleep with me,
Coz there's nothing more atypical,
That the two of us could be'.

I took a moment there to ponder that,
And power through double-vision,
Take her in with the scenery, like
The portrait of a landscape in remission.

"This isn't a relationship, this is friendship+",
'This is all that I can want with you, yet still it borders on too much'.
