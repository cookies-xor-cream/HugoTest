Emptying $2 Coins On An Adventure Game

I'll find you in another life,  
like the snow seeks out the summit,  
like the corvid find the highest branch,  
and perches atop, and makes a nest out of it.

I'll find you in a place,  
separate of, and torn from here,  
like the delta finds the sea,  
and completes the connection to the streams.

I'll find you like the current finds the circuit.  
I'll find you like the short must find the circuit break.  
I'll find you through the earthquakes,  
I'll find you in the tectonics as we shake.

I'll find you like the fissures find the faultline,  
I'll find you like we're running out of time.  
I'll find you like the vermins found as vectors,  
I'll find you in conjuctions and lyrical connectors.

I'll find you like you lost your language,  
I'll find you like you lost her housekeys,  
I'll find you like a transistor on an XOR switch,  
I'll find you like a lock finds its skeleton key.

I'll find you like splinters finds my finger,  
Like fallen fragment of the trees,  
I'll find you like there's no you or I,  
I'll find you and 'we' will be.

I'll find you like you are cash,  
and I'm the midnight vending machine,  
I'll find you through the anguish,  
I'll find you, and I'll set you free.

I'll find you in the break of dawn,  
a fawn without a mother, calling to the dusk,  
I'll find you like eclipses find the sun,  
I'll find your empty husk  
and I will make us one.
