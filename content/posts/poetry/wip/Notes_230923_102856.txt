My Organs Cannot Self-Arbitrate

If my diaphragm could please be still,
Thirty seconds at a time, I fucking plead,
Stop undulating from inhale to exhale,
All the breath I can give, I already gave.

If my eyes could please try to be shut,
Exempt from me the requirement of blinds,
I would fall asleep with only eyelids in view,
Instead of ceiling superposed by my thinking of you.
