Lest I Forget The Older Sister I Never Had

I forgot her surname,
And I've lost her address,
Almost completely forgotten her face,
I suppose we've been mutually replaced?

I'm happy for most of everything that's happened,
And there's things that I've wanted to change,
But isn't it better just to leave it in its place?

I like that it happened this way,
However stupid, however winding,
However much therapy it made
So many need (and I'm still counting).

You swear in that moment,
If we had brushed fates,
The circuit would complete,
But I don't agree with that,
Not in the same way.

I had an iron lung,
Waiting, idling at home,
And I'm happy that you left,
I could breathe better alone.

You made me unravel,
I wound you in vain,
But your springing was holding the
Pressure inside of my veins.

Your pictures came alive to the touch,
Played back memories of the desert and the beach,
But I stopped reminiscing years ago,
I think I'd had enough.

I wouldn't save a soul, least of all myself,
I'd take the past and hang it up,
Maybe inside of a pendant
Or falling from a torrent of nails,
Spanning my living room walls,
As a tapestry of tiny and still,
But still moving frames.
