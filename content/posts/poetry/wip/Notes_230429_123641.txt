Missing The Point Of Homer's Odyssey 

The self is a clipping of these monsters,
Which frets about the riverside,
In a failure to rehearse. 

I've got a pedigree of the bloodline,
Stuck between a set of options,
All of which remain declined. 

But after the wyrm's assassination,
Charybdis was the proof, that one
More reduction results in the lesser option. 

I saw Charybdis' coronation,
When I was shedding the sheathe,
Abandoning myelination in the heat.

I've got an inkwyrm in my head,
Soundbites from a script that I
Wish I'd never heard. 

I've got Charybdis in my chest,
A whirlpool of the ichor that
Bleeds when I profess. 

I've got Scylla in my hands,
A battle for where each
And every touch could land. 

I've got the manticore in my soul,
An amalgamation of all the parts,
Of all the people from which I stole.
