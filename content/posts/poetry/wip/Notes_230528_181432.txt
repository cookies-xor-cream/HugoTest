Audiophile

"Call me an audiophile, coz I'd love to hear you scream,  
You're like the cinders of the ashes of the remnants of my dreams,  
Brought to life, then ripped apart from the dreamscape, and back to me,  
Wails like fallen angels turned to shooting stars to home in onto me".

*"I'll call you an audiophile coz you'd love to hear my scream.*  
*However loud, the sonic fades in its egress from my dreams.*  
*I can't listen to the short dull buzz, however strong it bleeds.*  
*I'm missing all the downbeats of your wailing, I need to take the lead".*
