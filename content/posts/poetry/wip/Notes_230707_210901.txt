Append This To The List Of 'No's That Should've Been a 'Yes'

"She's so pretty, who would say no"

"She's pretty. Unfortunately, I don't think she's much other"

She's shallow, but she's fucking gorgeous,
And she thinks that can bridge the difference,
I almost asked her name like it wasn't a mistake,
But that's a risk that I'm not willing to now take.

I suppose it's shallow of me in turn,
To judgement pass on so little learned,
But I'm a cauldron and can't help but churn,
Long past since when this tonic's burnt.
