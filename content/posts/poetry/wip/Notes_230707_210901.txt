Don't Let Her Cook (She's Already Burnt The Soup)

She's shallow, but she's fucking gorgeous,  
And she thinks that can bridge the difference,  
I almost asked her name like it wasn't a mistake,  
But that's a risk that I'm not willing to take.

I suppose it's shallow of me in turn  
To judgement pass on so little learned,  
But I'm a cauldron and can't help but churn  
Long past since when the tonic's burnt.
