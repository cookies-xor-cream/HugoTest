Meteormancy And The Aeronautics Of Feeling

Corva Would've Loved This One (She Would've Stolen All Your Sandwiches)

There's a single feather on your head, a gift sans sentiment from the crow's nest in the branch strung looming overhead,  
And you're gorgeous in the discord of this hairstyle like the hatching of a stormcloud or a wispy plume of smoke.  
I suppose that it is in the likeness of your temper, that little angry shroud of your sparky stares like violent jolts of fervour,  
I wish you wouldn't catch your tongue on static, I want this channel clear, anything you want to say I swear I want to hear.

I can't spend my time playing with the dials in your brain, I know it for a fact all the recalibration I would do will be done in vain,  
You need presence of mind, and so I'm sorry and it's such a fucking shame that presence of body is all that I could ever do at best.  
I'm not about to waste my time playing with controls, each command I give you take feels like a remote access exploit,  
And I don't think that I want to be trusted with the heft of the ethical implications of having remote root access to your brain.

You call this love, I call it subordination, and you say that it's okay, but sweetheart tell me why does it feel so fucking strange?
