ThE biG rAcE In tHe Sky

I felt the right wrong end of a DUI,
She had a hell of an afternoon,
And I was just trying to pass her by,
But she got out, slurring like a sailor.

She asked if she had hurt me,
But I caught the car at walking pace,
Whereas she would end up in heaven,
If she chose to complete this race.

And so I set the terms and conditions,
And when the ink had dried, we agreed,
She gladly accepted my offer,
To park for her, so we struck the deal.

She promised me she'd get home safe,
And then she asked me for my number,
So she could buy me a coffee to make it up,
But if she tries, I'll decline the offer.

I wasn't exactly close to eager,
I could hear the voice echo,
"VƒÅi Ar, you sure know how to pick 'em",
So I think I'll let this go.

I'm bad with speed right now.
I think I'll take this slow.

Epilogue To The Epilogue

She actually made the call today,
But she was slurring still,
You know that if my heart was a house,
You'd find me straddling by the windowsill.

Because a reply of acceptance,
For her to buy me coffee,
Was a date planned as penance,
And that's not enough for me.

I'd rather have handed you back your car keys,
So you could finish what you started,
Take a couple shots, and return,
If only to have killed me.
