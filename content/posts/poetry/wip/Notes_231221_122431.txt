Bad, But Not So Bad. Good, But Not So Good

Sometimes you feel like a tree that's blessed with optical acuity,
You have roots and I have feet (and all the other normal human things),
I can't plant myself to grow, out here by your side I'd be dying in the sun,
I don't want to always feel like I settled for a helios, like I had jumped the gun.
And bullets do so little damage to your greenery, to your foliage and bark,
So I'm here unearthed and I suppose this is my chance to now embark?

But in a flurry of your flaunting lashes, you caught glimpses of the day,
Neatly packed and wedged between each blink and every dying stare,
You croaked a dying question, which I had caught in its decay,
I can't give the answer you requested, but it makes me want to stay.
It's not that I was caught off guard, "love"'s not that strong a word alone,
You're everything of which I could dream, it just doesn't feel like home.

Your self-defeating lips asked how many laps the clock has passed,
And if I really thought today would truly be the finale, the very last,
And if it had, then has it meaning or is it nothing except for crass?
I swear to god you're made from chips of long-felled timber wood,
Every time I brush your hair my right hand's palm is filled with spruce,
But believe me, if I could abstain and live without, I would.

The silence drew long, no matter how curt it really was,
And thus the riposte that you decided in all our quiet fuss
Was that whatever that this feeling was, fell so fastly unrequited,
And I agree with that, I just don't think that it's so goddamn bad.
I think 'love' is not so fitting for something known so fleeting.
For when day breaks open and sunshine starts to spill,
You will no longer catch me staring down your sleeping
From my favourite spot that I'd inherit upon your windowsill.
