Why does it feel that once in a week fate doctors a scene,
Had my back on a board, her palm pressed into my throat,
I swear to god this isn't what it might seem,
It's an orchestration, it's all her and in no part me.

The evidence was planted, I'm red handed and branded,
It's scribbled in scarlet, our darling's left-handed,
But you know I declined, I washed her digits away,
Ten down the sink, the soap keeps her contact at bay.
