title: You're On The Western-Most Coast From Me

Rummage through the scraps that you left,
feels like grave-robbing, feels like a ghost
caught me on the windowsill
and charged a tariff for the theft.

I'll trade your memories for the parts,
of the reboot that I need
for a clean slate, and restart,
to part from the salty air that you breathe.

Because the year we spent apart,
is downwardly displaced,
from the lump inside my throat,
to the trench inside my heart.

We're the dead-end of a no-through road,
a cul-de-sac pulled out your sleeve,
to reveal a losing hand and a misplaced
deck of cards, that you tried so very hard to steal.
