These scars, cut marks, and curt remarks,  
Are dusks well wasted by you and I,  
Indulging in your self-harming fantasies,  
Split the difference, don't share them with me.

I'm through, we're done, I've come undone,  
With eyes down the barrel of a loaded gun,  
You're two, we're one, I'm the barter for  
The palid moonlight reflecting the raging sun.

So charter a star, and conscript my hands,  
I'm the fine print in your finest demands,  
Of well laid schemes of mice that men  
Could never see or try to understand.

Reprimand all my darkest thoughts,  
We'll play this bench-side at a park,  
With whiskey-kevlar, like the river styx,  
With words like slugs, not stones or sticks.

And we'll catapult this muraled wall,  
If words wished to stick, they would adhese,  
When we hose it down the remainder paints  
Us a tapestry of our shared peace.
