My late lunch yesterday was taken up  
But without premeditation on my end,  
Though I doubt that I could say as much,  
For the scheming you played on your side.

I am not, and I never was, anything except  
A vessel for a transitory touch,  
A brush in an electric exchange of charge,  
Between my fingers and your palm.

It's just your palm.  
It's just your palm.  
It's just your palm.  
It's just your palm.

A panic attack hit me with such speed,  
That it missed me fucking entirely,  
My heart went so fast that it didn't beat at all.  
Cardiac valves turned to haemophobic walls.

I inhaled so sharp breath cut my lungs,  
Caught my diaphragm in a paradox,  
As if the engine in my chest aspirated on itself,  
And it began to sputter and to stall.

I'm in a free-fall at speed that's terminal,  
Not in finality of a picking pace,  
But the fast-forward to the full-stop of  
A funeral, for the friends that we replaced.

I can't write a single stanza, I've got  
Five sat in my brain.  
So I thought an amalgamation might  
Ease the tension off my head.

But now the "to" field of this letter,  
Is to you and to Euphie too.  
But I can't send either one by post,  
For letters need a real address.

The post office doesn't mail to ghosts,  
Or to strings of question marks, I suppose.

But would to the location 'you ingressed':  
The night spent on your bedroom floor.  
It's playing on repeat in my head.  
So could we make that the address?

Could we see this message sent  
Under your bedroom walk-in closet door,  
I'll scribble down an endorsement for  
A bedroom-closet lock adornment.

Let's see you sit in,  
Turn the key please, gorgeous

"Why me? Stick to girls.  
Fucker, how do I
Even dare compare?"

("Oh and by the way, a final footnote,  
I love whatever it is you've been doing  
With your hair")
