How Time Flies

You invited me to spend a Christmas with your mum, told her that you met someone, that you think you are in love.
So I don't know what to tell you, you know that it's all just in your head? That there is nothing here, that this fantasy is dead.
But I'll entertain delusion if it means that I get to see you smile, I'll wile away the holidays, get naphthalene to commit an infinite arson against time.
And when the rest of it is over, we'll look back upon that year but I'm miserable reminded how only one of us gets older around here.

Kick the clock while it is down, don't let it fly to its perch upon the wall. I've got minutes here to spare.
I've got time here left to kill while my memories all flash back like a shitty production of a budget indie film,
Like a makeshift powerpoint of these self-imbued fragments of these tiny moving stills.

I've got time here left to kill,
I've still got time here left to kill.
