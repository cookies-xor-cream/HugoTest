The light olive skin  
and sable gem eyes,  
were the theory and palette  
of your Saturday nights.

The colours you wore  
were the shade I adored,  
and her hallways all hung  
mediterra adorned.

I hate to let down,  
but I'm one with the ground,  
you said stay clear of the quicksand,  
but I've already drowned.

For sister, you know,  
I'm not fond of solipsis,  
but you've got me swapping  
stops with ellipses.

And now I'm hanging on fast,  
on a paragraph's edge,  
hoping the footnote's a  
foothold off of this ledge.

Don't make medio from medi,  
coz I'm the prefixed by 'de',  
and I'd rather the middle  
than scared halfway to death.

I know if I lived as a rat,  
you'd say I'm feigning my death,  
but pretending to live  
is taxing twofold the breath.

Can't take the brunt of the toll,  
but what use is crossing the bridge?  
what use is learning to swim  
when the sea can be cinched?
