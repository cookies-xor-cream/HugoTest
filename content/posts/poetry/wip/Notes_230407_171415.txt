I'm A Signal Flare: The Brighter Byproducts

I feel like I operate on a different timescale than everybody else,
In a dry world that's burning down,I'm caught up in the oxides,
Nitrogen went and found my name, an accelerant formed within the flame,
They caught fire but I caught infernos, with everything besides me burning.

And I'd roll through the sand, but I can't risk depressing the embers,
No I want the angry cinders, I need this flare to last through December.
