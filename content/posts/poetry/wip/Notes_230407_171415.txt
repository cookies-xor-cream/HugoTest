I'm A Signal Flare: The Brighter Byproducts

I feel like I operate on a different timescale than everybody else,  
in a dry world that's burning down,I'm caught up in the oxides,  
nitrogen went and found my name, an accelerant formed within the flame,  
they caught fire but I caught infernos, with everything besides me burning,  
alit and aflame.

And I'd roll through the sand, but I can't risk depressing the embers,  
no I want the angry cinders, I need this flare to last through till December.
