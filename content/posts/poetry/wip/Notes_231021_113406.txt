'No Vacancy' (Leave So I Can Cull The First Half, I'm Not A Fucking Hotel Sweetheart)

How the fuck do you think it appropriate,
Or even professional in the slightest extent,
To place your chin, nestled, onto my shoulder.

I thought that you finally fucking agreed,
You said you would leave me the hello alone,
So why does this bench have a lit up 'no'?
