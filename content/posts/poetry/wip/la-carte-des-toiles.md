Look with me where the night sky  
Meets the salt-spangled ocean,  
It's a bed of stars dragged across,  
Like a strobing tracer set in motion.

Please bring to me andromeda,  
It's just far too far away,  
But now that it's caught my attention,  
My eyes are chasing every stellar ray.

I don't wanna be forward,  
But I'm not made for subtlety,  
I know that you're nebulous,  
But would you like a slice of reality?

Cygnus, I saw your feathers bloom,  
So I'll be plucking you for down,  
You better be laying really low,  
Until you fizzle in the dawn.

It's so much harder to find you,  
Without the lines here in the charter,  
And you caught on the sky's edge,  
Stuck hugging the horizon.
