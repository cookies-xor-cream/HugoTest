title: 'My Guard Is Never Down (Break It)'

If you knock down my guard then all you have left are four fallen walls encasing a box made of lead.

I keep a failsafe in place for my head, like a safe in a safe, or a key under mat for the lock to a key in a vase.

You say you want it direct, but if you could direct, then in the scene after next Checkov would fire a gun in his face.

And it seems that it wasn't a prop we prepared, but paraphernalia a crackhead smuggled onto the set.

And if 'crackhead' is right, then they should be taking a crack at cracking the safe, or the code if they can't.

I'll give them a clue, it's got three digits the same, they look like a letter, they can sound like a swoon.

And if you come closer to me, then I'll give you the code by taking the liberty to ring it for you.

It's not that I hate you, it's that we're alone in your room.
