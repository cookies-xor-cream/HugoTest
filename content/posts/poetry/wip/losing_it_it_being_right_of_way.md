Stephanie's surfaced the best of me,  
through her sliplane ways and road tax payed,  
she played this game but chose to stay  
to wedge me out an automotive grave.

The zebra crossing must dissolve  
at contact with every driver's eyes,  
coz no one fucking stops or pauses,  
when a pedestrian's been wanting to cross it.

And Stephanie knows it all too well,  
I'll egress this mortal plane through traffic,  
coz if I want to transcend this place,  
I sure as hell could afford the mortal tariff.

So she rang my phone, from two cars down,  
told me to drop it, and to walk away,  
that the old lady sitting, seething in her benz,  
isn't worth a verbal combat to the death.

She took me to the bus stop,  
and when I missed it, the train,  
I missed both of them in double today,  
but I think that I'm gonna be okay.

I'm gonna fucking be okay.  
I'm gonna fucking be okay.
