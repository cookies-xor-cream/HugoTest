Fenestrationally challenged architecture  
Is so quick to depress a bedroom-dweller,  
For people need sunlight as flowers do too,  
I'd hate to be diurnal trapped in a windowless room.

I'm happy that you have a balcony to chase  
All of the sunlight that you mightâ€™ve craved,  
But I take it by possession of her vitamin D,  
That your sister is victim to the layout's decree.
