Nearing twenty two, I'm glad that I had spent my most recent youthfulness trying to pretend that I'm a teenager and pretend that you are too.

Over these last few years I've rid myself of stupid fears long passed. Of all the phantom touch of ghosted limbs that cling me to a historic distant past.

So I thought that I might try recount the little growth that I might have had. And lay happy in the thought that my anxiety's no longer out of hand.

I don't know where she was buried, I never asked, so each time I passed a cemetery the same tremor manifested to hijack both my hands.

And you could call it what you want, try to diagnose this film reel flipping through my mind, this projector stuck to play on repeat behind my eyes.

But I think that an acronym is crude, some rude medical explanation of all the dumb things that I do when I only ask to be simply understood.

And I suppose I never felt that way with her, but that's always how I fucking feel and all I fucking feel when I'm with you (isn't that good?)

I don't want to be explained, don't want someone who thinks that we are glass, that's walking on eggshells, no that would never last.

If you learn to hit undo, to avoid the things you do that make me scared, then there'll be nothing of us left. And you'll find yourself unpairing or unpaired.

So then tell me Cadmium, are we lucky heavy metals accumulate, or cursed that you can't exodus?

Is it good to have stability, (though I never asked for it), or was it better to stay lonely but be free?
