The Latency Of Being A Person Who Must Live A Life In A World Full Of People Each Living Their Own

You live everything after the fact,
No one's ever told another of anything until it's over.

My friends are afraid of talking,
I guess that's what happens when cuts the seams.

Dollface you've got stitches
Holding hostage closed your plastic lips.

They need a swig or five of vodka,
To access the endless trauma dumping vibe.

In excess or found sorely lacking
Are the two modes that this world is granting you.

Either bursting at the seams with life,
Or an empty shell craving tomorrow's ghost's cavity yesternight.

Any tense except the present
Is a hypothesis of anachronism,
Some fabled bit of tragedy,
A glimpse into your yesteryear for me.
