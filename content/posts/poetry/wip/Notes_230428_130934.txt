A Prompt For Her Suicide: She RSVPed 'No'

My heart stood still, basked in the image,
Of her straddling off the windowsill,
Sitting in the delicate and dismal visage.
I think I told her "jump?", but she put something in my drink.
So I don't remember enough,
And lost the patience to clearly think.

I could live on this ledge forever,
But I'd sooner sever every tie,
Between my pinhole cameras,
And the asphalt in her eyes.
