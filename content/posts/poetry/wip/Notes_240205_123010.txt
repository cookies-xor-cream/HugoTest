I Miss My Friend

And you're one of the few afraid to call, but I'm okay with SMS, everytime I talk to you I cry. And I doubt that ages well.

Every time I talk to you, I'm weak of heart and always short of breath.

I hope your sister's doing well, I hope she's treating kitty right. I know you miss the way he gnawed, and the savage way he bites. It must be fucking hard to sleep without him cradled in your arms. Without his little teeth as a reminder you're alive.

You say life is quieter down here, but I feel so distant since you've moved back this past year. Every other night, you called me when you were over east, and now you're back, it feels like we go weeks and never speak.

I hate you a little bit sometimes for your last visit home. You asked me if I still had a girlfriend and then proceeded to ignore my answer (why even ask?).

You visited again after that. But you avoided me. I know why, but it still feels like shit. You never even told me you were in the fucking city, I found out on my own.

And now that you're back you're like that again. Always avoiding me in person, flaking out on plans. And you're so fucking awkward about any physical contact.

I just want my friend back.
