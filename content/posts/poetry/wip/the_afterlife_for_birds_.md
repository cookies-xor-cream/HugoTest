I wonder if Corva would like to freeze-fame as a crow,  
A dead dance on her casket in a fossilised repose,  
Or prefer an exit in the pose that she would sleep,  
Never uncovered, forever a denizen of the deep.

But to swim is pescan, flight is more fitting of a bird,  
I hope she's not cast to an afterlife wading through the dirt,  
Through strife she'll fly on spiny and unfeathered wings,  
Tethered not to earth, but to the anima she finds within.
