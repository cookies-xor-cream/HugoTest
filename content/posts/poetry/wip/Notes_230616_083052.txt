Paris (Not To Be Confused With Parīsā) 

You asked if I'd like to head inside,  
but reluctantly, I then declined  
my prison's not the morning sun,  
no, I'm not working a nine to five.

If I could try tonight again,  
you know, I'd only change a single thing,  
I wish that I could fall for you,  
but the issue's me, it isn't you.

I want to want to want to want,  
but my desire's written in white on white,  
it's a ghost asleep in idle haunt,  
inside the clockwork of my heart.

I feel I'm far too stubborn in every step,  
like I take a dozen back for each one ahead,  
if I could feel with my head instead,  
I'd be seeing pink in place of red.
