At The River With A Tree Nymph

"How long?"

*"Four or five years, if I'm lucky"*

"Is it insult to injury if I ask you for a month?"

*"A month of what?"*

"Fuck... Friendship?"

I've never seen, even in death, the light flicker out of someone's eyes so fast.

For a short moment, you said you swore that you saw the future, that you wouldn't die alone.

But how accurate are prophecies anyways, Delphi was blind after all, wasn't she?

You said that you were casket-bound,  
Diagnosed as born to die, and terminal.  
Well, if it's any consolation sugar,  
I'd love to attend your funeral.

I'd come to your appointments,  
You can keep me in the waiting room,  
I'd watch you struggle and we would  
Skirt around, delay your doom.

But you said that you don't want that,  
That I still have all my life to live,  
That this is too much to ask for,  
And it's far too much to give.

I resumed, please don't think that way,  
Let's re-meet up at the Grecian coast,  
We'll seek out the boatman, Charon,  
And your final Stygian-bound repose.

We can be Ophelius and Euridicy,  
By the Euphrates, as it flows into the sea,  
I'll meet you where the salt collides,  
To wash the clairvoyance from your eyes.

I don't know what it was in what I said,  
But you felt that the sentiment deserved,  
Something more than your cross to bear,  
So you leaned too close, and shared your curse.  
   
Something more than touch, a kiss?  
I'm so fucking sorry cookie, but that's  
Sentiment I'd scarcely come to miss.
