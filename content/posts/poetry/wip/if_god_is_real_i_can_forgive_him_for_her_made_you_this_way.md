I ran into her today.  
her heels were higher,  
and her coat was longer.  
her new wardrobe  
didn't quite look like  
it belonged upon her.

Where's the teenage girl,  
that hated boys but  
loved the church?  
I want her back.  
I don't recognise this woman,  
clad head to toe in a funeral dress.

I wanna talk to her again,  
I don't know the  
half of all the trauma,  
but if she would let me,  
then I would love to  
rehash this old-world drama.

She's changed so much,  
and I need to know  
if she can be catalysed,  
or this is finalised,  
know if this frame of her's  
was recast in stone.

Is she canonised?  
did this cast set her bones?
