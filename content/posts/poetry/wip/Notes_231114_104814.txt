She Was Rambling As We Loaded* Her Into Your Car And I Wish I Could 

*Loaded, like something inanimate, because she was less a person and more a vessel for alcohol at that point in time

These aren't rose stained glasses,
They are bloodspots in my eyes,
I swear I see pink instead of black
Whenever I try to pull the blinds.

And yes, it's nice, just useless,
It's got my heart rate in triple digits,
And my lungs in failed ventilation
Thinking about our ventuple digits.
