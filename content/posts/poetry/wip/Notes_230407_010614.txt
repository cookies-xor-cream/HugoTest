One More Week; Just In Case

I think tonight was the last living proof,  
I store my details in my dreams,  
everything important is hidden  
under the parchment and the seams.

We both have one bullet in the chamber,  
so kiss me or just kill me where I stand,  
because I can't imagine living through  
a world where I can't hold your hand.
