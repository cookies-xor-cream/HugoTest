The Riptide Stole A Mute Man's Pen

I cracked my pen nib,
Drawing a cleft unto my lip,
So that when my tongue slipped,
My words had somewhere to spill.

But little did I know,
They had nowhere left to go,
And the cut that I had made,
Now infinitely grows.

I've got ink on my mouth,
And pencil lead at hand,
And when either come out,
They float when they land.

But there's no littering on the bridge,
I read the sign, and it's sinking in,
So help me grab a hairclip,
To put a pin in it.
