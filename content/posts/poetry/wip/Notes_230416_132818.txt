My Balance Has Rusted Over, Now I'm Paying With Bloodwork Credit

I finally lost the bruises that I picked up
When I planted my hand on the street,
I suppose that plant couldn't grow inside my pockets,
Which was dry in the rain, dying discrete.

I watched the blue and black blur,
Rurn back to a beige-tanned receipt,
I guess they couldn't find the sunlight
From denim concrete that refused to recede.

Hand me an eraser, I'll whiteout the veins,
Then hand me a pencil, I need them replaced,
I know I can't move them too far,
I just want them downwardly displaced.

You say I'm too happy, I think I'm happy enough,
You say that I'm jaded, but my life isn't that rough,
You say I need plumbing, for the bloodwork gone wrong,
I think my pipes are in order, as opposed to your tongue.
