I could barely picture her, and lost all traces of her voice,  
my best attempt has lost inflection and dropped the tone that I deposed,  
but her's isn't the only timbre I can't quite seem to pin down,  
I feel like a sonic vacuity, like my ears are blackholes for the sound.

My retinas must not bounce the light as correctly as they think,  
because every time I conjure faces, all the features start to shrink,  
like the absence of a person is where their features are,  
like everyone is left remasked, wearing a clean and empty scar.
