Hair Ties And Half-Hearted Retries

I always leave in three acts,
Can't get it right with only twice,
I think the elasticity to snap back,
Isn't flexibility, but instead a vice.

You have to pull the rubber thin,
Until hooke's law no longer stands,
Or else you'll find me releasing
The tension in this elastic band.

If you pull too short, it'll harshly land,
It'll snap straight back into your hand.
