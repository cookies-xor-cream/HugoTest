Drunk On Chronic Pain

My doctor showed me an archaic scan,  
Some long-forgotten ancient artifact,  
Magnetic resonance imaging caching  
The flaws inside the maker's stitching.

Don't shoot the messenger, fire down the news,  
I would but my trigger finger's short a muse,  
So unlike Apollo painting the ravens black,  
I found that my wrath was sorely lacked.

He pointed out a few dim readings,  
Indications of pain I won't stop feeling,  
Like a lightning bolt stuck inside my spine,  
That transmutes my blood into electric wine.

But amidst the thunder, I found a cygnus,  
It was faded but it had surely lingered,  
So I searched the constellation to double check,  
And saw the map of it checkered beneath my shirt.

The picture loading on my phone,  
And the picture of my insides showed,  
That they didn't match, but it was close.  
After all, nyxkin always bury bones.
