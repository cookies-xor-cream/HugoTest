My Life Is A Play Written In 2B Pencil

I'm no stranger to a quiet finale,
To the banality of a curtain call,
Where backstage gets held up by
all of these costume changes,
And now the lead has got to stall.

I'm no stranger to a quiet finish,
A slow recession to a dimmed diminish.
The subtle fading of the wanton feeling,
Of all these dismissed rebuttals stating
Love could never be so fleet a feeling.

I'm no stranger to this method acting,
The best way to make it convincing 
Is to go on out and catch the feeling,
And though it might not put your
Soul at ease...

I didn't mean anything by my actions,
Please dig that grave and make your peace.
I'm nothing if not a ledger's enactor.

I think I lost you along the way,
Through dead vernacular, my words decayed.
And so I'd love to help you fill that grave.

But how many nights between us two
Will end in empty cups and missing shoes?

How many times will you lose your heels,
Before you realise vacancy is all I feel?

This reads so poorly without the context,
But I don't mind the subtle looks and blatant judgement.

I just want to put this being to paper,
But ink won't stab at ballpoint through the pages,
I need a stanza enscribed in something stronger than a pencil,
Something that can survive erasures.

But I guess death is too good an eraser.
