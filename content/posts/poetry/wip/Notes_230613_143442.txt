The Curse Of Drowning: Treading Water Centreworld

The light olive skin
And sable gem eyes,
Were the theory and palette
Of your Saturday nights.

The colours you wore
Were the shade I adored,
And her hallways all hung
Medi-terra adorned.

I hate to let down,
But I'm one with the ground,
You said stay clear of the quicksand,
But I've already drowned.

For sister, you know,
I'm not fond of solipsis,
But you've got me swapping
Stops with elipses.

And now I'm hanging on fast,
On a paragraph's edge,
Hoping the footnote's a
Foothold off of this ledge.

Don't make medi to medio,
Coz I'm the prefixed by 'de',
And I'd rather the middle
Than scared halfway to death.

I know if I lived as a rat,
You'd say I'm feigning my death,
But pretending to live
Is taxing twofold the breath.

Can't take the brunt of the toll,
But what use is crossing the bridge?
What use is learning to swim
When the sea can be cinched?
