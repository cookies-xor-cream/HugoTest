Depressive Episode Blocked Out On My Calendar

She left me a voicemail asking me if I'm free to wile my birthday,
She knows full well I fucking hate her but if left to my devices I'd deflate,
Call up someone that I probably shouldn't to sat something that I can't,
With an insert of a stupid quote from Kafka and too little of you inside my hands.
