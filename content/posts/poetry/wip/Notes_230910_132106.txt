To Be The Willing Victim Of A Reveral Murder-Suicide

There are ways to end a life
Without committing murder,
There are ways that one can listen
Without ever having heard her.

There's a pattern to my sleeping,
An equation defining all my dreams,
I always know ahead of time,
As random as each one might seem.

There's a winter in the early spring,
Fragments of past seasons lost,
Each of my attempts to thaw,
See me glazed in ice, encased in frost.

There's summer found in early death,
A heat distilled that strikes you down
Each of your attempts to chill,
Still see you in the burning drown.

And so had you knives, I'd ask to leave,
Via only sharp and pointy things,
It's not like you have never tried,
So emigrate me from my life.

Had you harboured words, I'd ask to die,
They're so much sharper than your knives,
An arsenal that's made for me,
'Goodbye' will boot me from this dream.

Give me an easier exit out,
From this spectral sorry space,
That I have found myself about.
Mark my reveries 'to be replaced'.
