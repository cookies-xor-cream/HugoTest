Remember my penchant for these words that died with her, which hurt. But kid just because she has bit the dirt doesn't mean that my vocabulary's craving to be curt.

I'll live long but still move fast. A different dumb choice every day, live each one like it's the last. Like my heart's not made of glass, like my being's clad in brass and cast to last.

I'll hold your ghost inside my mind, that spectre always haunting that never seems to find what it desired. As if failure by design of an assignment or a cause to be resigned.

Call me manic, call me crazed. Call this a dementious stupor or an existential tantrum come giftwrapped in a daze. Whatever it might be, to carry on needs more urgency I've got left in me.

I won't making it past the city, not on foot. I ran 6k, that's all I could, I haven't fervour left to spare. So phantom, hear you me. Am I understood, excused? Am I adjourned, do you refuse?

I haven't range, I haven't breadth. I can roam out to the sea but can't strand halfway straddling death. By every growing vacancy of every parting breath I took, only to quickly then recede.

See me here, see me now. If you lack your eyes yet still, please just fucking see to it somehow. Do so the same way that I see long since now deferred the image of that twilight on her face.

That picture of the broken placid dawn, sitting teasing at the off-white picket fence. Excavate this corpse of memory in my head, and leave it here, buried and long since left for dead.

I said bow, can you bow now? Do you have room enough inside that box left six feet underground?

I said pray, can you pray now? Rescind me every thought I sow like a chasmic undertow that lets you know the harvest is denied.

I said cry, could you weep now? If you'd please then I'd sleep soon or even now. If you'd drown me like the harvest you could reap me with the best of it, just as we rehearsed.

Drag me by the wrist, or entice me with the poison sitting in the space between your wide and open lips. By the words that force my move, or the sleight of hand that I always have found crude.

I always thought a death by drowning would be cute.

If your words are what you'll use then see your verbiage plucked straight from this thin air, before it fizzles out to reacquaint my existence with the dirt.

Sorry if this was poor in taste. Fool I am, I love to tempt the fates. I just assume that you were buried but she won't tell me at which place. Either way, this is not a letter but request, and the rest assured I rest assured that I have made my sincere and solemn case.
