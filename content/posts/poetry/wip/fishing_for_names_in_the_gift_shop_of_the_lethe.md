I read the tag and bartered down,  
But I suspect not well enough,  
Coz all that love afforded me,  
Was cast aside into the deep.

What price to pay for wanderlust,  
For murky sleeps and wayward haunts,  
For wakeful dreams walking steeple steps,  
To reclaim dregs from muddied depths.

For resurrecting revenants,  
For these irreverent reveries.

I never believed so much in you,  
But I'm glad that you believed in me.
