If Heaven Wants Another Angel, It Should Take Back Azrael

Meet the reaper,  
See this relayed,  
I'd gladly go, if only  
You could stay.

This angel's runway's  
Ripe with bends,  
It's got twists and turns,  
But now they come to end.

And yet even then,  
We got to savour  
Each and every  
Fleeting second.

And with each and  
Every passing minute,  
I'm paralysed by happiness,  
Just to have been in it.

As above, so below  
From dust to dust,  
We come the same  
Way that we must go.

As above, so below,  
From ash to ash,  
We're in fire wrought,  
In a simmer or a flash.

As above, so below,  
In fire and brimstone,  
We're all charred  
Straight into fragile bones.

As above, so below,  
The future's in the past,  
A living rusted cycle,  
Found in chrome recast

Life can be short,  
But some things,  
Just aren't meant  
To last.

Yet I still can wish  
That her life hadn't  
Passed me by  
So fast.

Yet still now hereafter,  
Outlasting her, we soldier on,  
We'll walk for her,  
Since she was forced to run.
