Puppy Is Such A Stupid Petname

She wanted something shallow,
Something fast,
Something infinitely more crass,
So it wouldn't last.
And as such I fashioned it from glass,
But when the time had come,
Goodbye was due, and this would come to pass,
I found that I was stuck,
Couldn't loosen the grip inside my hands,
So bogged down and muddled up,
I wore beneath my sleeve a tapestry of canine cuts
And it's such a shame that none would ever see
my many gorgeous imprints of my puppy's teeth.
