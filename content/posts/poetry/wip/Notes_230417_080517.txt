Reverse Polarity: The Northern Cygnus Hates The Horizon

You call it a jaw, but I would dispute,
It's role as a maw, its angle's always acute
You need a hinge for that name, to open up wide,
To keep the chattering bolted, tame and inside.

You're an eater of guilt, I'm not pushing the practice,
You found The Firebrick Atlantic and bestowed it a kiss,
The red's stuck on your lips like the roof of your house,
Like the traffic light that'll signal stop to the fuss.

You've got her on the floor of your bedroom,
But know that she's leaving real soon,
There's finite drink on the shelf,
And she's here for herself.

I can understand the bitterness, I hate to have gone,
I just hope that on the other side, you can see to your swan.
