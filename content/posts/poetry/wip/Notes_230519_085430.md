Saw her while I was talking to you,  
Thought I was going crazy.  
She made herself at home,  
Strewn against the brick and  
Mortar of the wall.  
There's no in between,  
She either heard nothing,  
Or she had heard it all.  
She came by after you  
Got into your car, to ask  
Who the fuck you are.  
I should've took the ride  
But when you offered it, but  
Something didn't sit quite right.  
In the aftershock of "It'll be  
More fun inside", I'll put a  
Full stop here, I'm not looking  
To punctuate this night.
