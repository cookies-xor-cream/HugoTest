Euphie's Vase Of Roses And The Spectacular Decision To Self-Operate (I Own A Knife, And So It Must Be Fate That Guides My Hand)

Can't smell this rose if it wilts in my hand,
Or make concessions for where it chooses to land,
My dorsum's decided to keep hostage a punctured-through palm,
Substituting violence in place of my calm.

So I've got an emergency surgery now planned,
Digging at the thorn that's stuck deep in my hand,
I can see as it coils the entire way through,
Wouldn't've been able to operate in the absence of you.

I've got a glass full of whiskey to shrug off the shake,
To dispel tremor I get when I see my skin break,
And I'm on a six hour call, my phone loose on my face,
Play the assistant as I return this thorn to a vase.
