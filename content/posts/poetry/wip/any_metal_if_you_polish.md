Keep doing what you're doing,  
I swear to you that the pain will subside,  
went from "I wanna die" to "it's so gorgeous to live",  
like I found a dying volcano,  
and I chose to live inside.

The group of them said something,  
I can't quite remember the words,  
but I remember the gist of the complaining,  
that I'm going too fast but living too slow,  
that I love alchemy reversed,  
making tin out of gold.

I'd mark up the thought,  
but it's long since been sold.
