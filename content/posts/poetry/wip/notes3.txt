If My Life Was A Play They Fucked Up The Casting

There's a sparkle in her eyes
That isn't in mine,
But it sees me to a seizure every
Once in seldom while.

There's a breath in her lungs
That isn't in mine,
But I pretend that I still exhale
Just fine most of the time.

There's a pulse in her chest
That was ripped out of mine,
But I can't be bothered to
Miss it all the time.

You can be the queen Oberon,
And I'll play a midnight Puck.
We're in a midwinter nightly tempest,
But we don't give the slightest fuck,
we believe that we deserve it.
