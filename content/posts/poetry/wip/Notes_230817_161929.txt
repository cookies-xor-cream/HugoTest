Is My Life Is A Telethon For My Euthanasia?

I turned on her TV, and realised shortly after, the picture was off. There was some burn-in. Remnants of pictures that shouldn't still be there.

I think my hand is going to scar. And she is covered head to toe in permanent markings (whether ink, or blade, or something other).

It's got me thinking about how it's hard to abandon or fight context for most people. History sticks for her. I think maybe I should feel lucky that I forget so much. I feel like my life is episodic sometimes.

Someone asked me how I'd been at work today. I didn't remember him at fucking all. Maybe I'm lucky.

Or maybe this lightness isn't so light after all.

Her tattoo unravelled, split in twine, wide open,
Loosened it's grip on its design,
Turned black and yellow, all monochrome,
Like the outline to your ulnar scars.

Although you had the longest sleeves,
And your wrist-side marks would seldom show,
I think I would prefer my hands in place
Of your wardrobe: superseded, superimposed.

You were like a bad dream on repeat,
A nightmare-addiction I couldn't seem to beat,
Like I was captive to the fugue of a burned-in
After-image on a shitty OLED screen.

Somewhere in the rain, or in the
Air between our hands, we birthed
The beginning of a spark that
We would never understand.

You gave a whisper as a scream,
Like a stop sign that came painted green,
And every time I try to read the sign,
I swear, it's dodging contact with my eyes.

If I checked the bin behind your place,
I'm sure that I would find that screen,
An ovepriced OLED TV, with one too many
Memories burnt in, and stuck between,
My preteens and my twenties.
