Bye Max, Give My Regards

He asked me why I was sitting out, not doing work, at the park. I told him it's because my battery wasn't out.

He asked what was wrong with my arms so I got out my flashlight and showed him them. He just asked "FSM, nice, what're the valid expressions?"

I gestured at one, "nothing", and then at the other, "everything but". He seemed rather happy with that response and told me that it seemed like something I would get.

He sat besides me a short while. And we talked about nothing important, like we hadn't for so long prior.

It's nice to just enjoy his company, for the first time in five long years. Nothing dramatic or urgent.

He told me my eyes were a little brighter than they normally were. Today, though a little long between plans in four ply, was happy. He said I looked happy all month.

I got up to leave, and he told me he loved me. I turned around to let him know I can't in good faith echo the sentiment, and thanked him for the time instead.

And so the last thing he'd ever say to me will be "only if I was so lucky".
