Isoelectric Glucoacquiescence: Coulombic Gradients

I'm breathing so steady,
You're enjambing your breath,
I can feel your heart beat,
Escaping your chest.

You're like sugar in steam,
A sweet sacharrine beam,
From a glucose beacon,
Found cached in a dream.

Im ebbing the flow,
Youre flooding the ebb,
You're edging me onto this
Turbulent thread.

Now you've got a fistful of flannel,
And I've got a fistful of shirt,
But I'm comatose, cookie,
So let's quit out this bench?

I think that we gambled
More than we have,
We're liquid sweetheart,
Please let go of my hands?

"Too much; too fast;
I don't feel anything?
Why don't I feel it?
Do you?"

"Your heart.
It's slow.
Hold up,
Feel this..."

She pressed my index finger into her throat.
She must've been playing the night at double the speed.
Because when I dropped down my hand to meet at the source,
I could feel her tachycardia hold captive a storm.

She assumed the same position in mimicry,
Scouted my vitals for thunder and for lightning,
But Zeus decreed, we stole enough excitement for the pair,
And so he had no more left now to spare.

Searching for words felt hopeless,
I could only find two in the form of "I'm sorry?",
But she smiled, pulled me back to seated,
And told me "you don't ever need to be,
Withdrawal is automatically forgiven".
