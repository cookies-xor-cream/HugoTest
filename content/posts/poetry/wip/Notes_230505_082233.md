"Don't Trust The Brunette, She's Too Pretty To Be Good News"
- a neighbour, in passing

I threw the flowers in the bin at the park,
Shouldn't've read the tag: "I'll see you soon enough",
Hell of declaration for anyone to send,
Don't know what purpose it might serve or protect.

I cut my hand on the thorns,
Feels like the bleeding's forlorn,
Just tell me if the purpose,
Was to depress or impress.
