Moons Of Jupiter: The 3 Body Problem Is Evidence We're A Ternary System

"If you had a taser and a knife,
You'd make a moon of Jupiter,
Coz I've not cleared my orbit,
But instead I've fixated".

When I used that line on her,
I didn't expect that she'd know
What the fuck I was on about,
But that's how gambling can go.

"Thanks for the dodge
Of that ambulance ride,
You said I'd mangle so pretty,
But it's not my time yet to die.

So as your present,
I'll give option to Io,
For the gravity defied,
A coursely defined IOU".
