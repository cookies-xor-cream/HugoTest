Moons Of Jupiter: The 3 Body Problem Is Evidence We're A Ternary System

*"If you had a taser and a knife,*  
*you'd make a moon of Jupiter,*  
*coz I've not cleared my orbit,*  
*but instead I'm fixating upon her".*

When I used that line on her,  
I didn't expect that she would know  
what it was I was on about,  
but that's how gambling tends to go.

"Thanks for the dodge  
of that ambulance ride,  
you said I'd mangle so pretty,  
but it's not my time yet to die.

So as your present,  
I'll give option to Io,  
for the gravity defied,  
a coarsely defined IOU to you".
