Screaming Goodbye Through The Panama Canal: I Hope My Words Crossed The Atlantic

I revel in the asymmetry,
of the sights we've seen,
the words unsaid, and the
person I never got to see you be.

You're a parrot held captive
by your own choice of a cage,
you taught yourself to perform,
well, now, this is your stage.

"Leave me alone"
is a hint you can take,
a bid for adieu,
I know that it's hard
but I suggest that you do.

You don't have to ask me,
you know that I've missed you,
for god's sake Amber,
saying it out loud
won't make it any more true.
