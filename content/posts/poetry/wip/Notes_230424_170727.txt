Screaming Goodbye Through The Panama Canal: I Hope My Words Crossed The Atlantic

ParÄ«sa said to call back, but there's a reason I'm not receiving your calls. It was an amazing intermission to the 2010s, but it can't be 2015 forever.

I revel in the asymmetry,
Of the sights we've seen,
The words unsaid and the
Person I never got to see you be.

You're a parrot held captive
By your own choice of a cage,
You taught yourself to perform,
Well, this is your stage.

"Leave me alone"
Is a hint you can take,
A bid for adieu,
I know that it's hard
But I suggest that you do.

You don't have to ask me,
You know I missed you,
For god's sake Amber,
Saying it out loud
Won't make it any more true.
