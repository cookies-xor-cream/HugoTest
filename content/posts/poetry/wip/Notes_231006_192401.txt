Lithium Poisoning

I got called on over to the ER,
No less, on the tail end of Sunday night.
For a girl who through intention,
Has got her stomach getting pumped.

I wish that you'd take all your pills,
How they prescribed those things to you,
Honestly, friend, I'm out of rope,
Tell me what in the fuck am I to do?

I'm in the waiting room, sat stuck,
Frozen six feet from that girl,
And I'm steady, but she's breaking down,
Pulling out all of her hair.

She detailed me what had gone down,
Said that you're conscripted in a war,
Something about a diagnosis,
And constantly trying to crash your car.

We went to her's in the morning,
My eyes anchored to the ground,
There was an outline traced around,
But with bottles instead of chalk.

Your meds were emptied,
Scattered on her floor.
Enough lithium for batteries
To turn a profit around onto.

But you tried to liquidate,
To cut the symptoms, not the roots.
Lucky the devil's not a botanist,
For the reaper's missed his cue.
