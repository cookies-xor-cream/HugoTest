I sat halfway down the staircase, enrooted in your limbs. I felt at ease repurposed as nothing but your seat,  
You stared up at the treeline as my eyes fixated on the streetlight bouncing off the deltas down beneath,  
I felt at home being planted in your tandem, on the concrete at this vertigo-addled waterfront scenery,  
The drop made me so dizzy, but my head spins faster with my gaze fixed on my greened-out black-haired deity.

It's a hug like an ego death, breaking the boundaries between you and all that which may be left of me.
