Her Hair Dye

You got your head painted like a housefire,  
So ironically, it's a fire hydrant shade,  
You asked me what I'm looking for,  
And I answered honestly, how'd you take it cool?  
You reflected back at me this torrid look.  
Get me ventilation, coz I'm 'bouta lose my head,  
I liked your old hair better, and I liked it better stained.  
Now it's all just bloody smears,  
A tasteless red on red.
