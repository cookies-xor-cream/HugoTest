Her Hair Dye

You got your head painted like a housefire,  
so ironically, it's a fire hydrant shade,  
you asked me what I'm looking for,  
and I answered honestly, how'd you take it cool?  
you reflected back at me this torrid look.  
get me ventilation, coz I'm 'bouta lose my head,  
I liked your old hair better, and I liked it better stained.  
now it's all just bloody smears,  
a tasteless red on red.
