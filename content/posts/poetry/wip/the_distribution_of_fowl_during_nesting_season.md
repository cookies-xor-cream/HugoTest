She asked me why I saved her date,
I told her that it's pointless to cage a bird
If you wish to see it fly, and so I just acted
In her best interest the previous night.

I asked her why she hopped the fence,
When she could choose to fly away,
She said that her wings were confused,
When she'd been so trained to stay in place.

And so spine-slated on the brickwork beneath,
I lay scattered besides her splayed-out digits,
They were punctuated with a shattered golden ring,
And the brushing of her fingers made it far too hard to think.

I felt thinned out, diluted in my own existence,
Like I only seldomly and emergently existed,
Like my being is a function of her feathers and her wings,
Like reality's a space found only in contact with her wrists.
