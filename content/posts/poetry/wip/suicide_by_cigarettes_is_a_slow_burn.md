Mephitic ticks of dimly opalescent wisps incarnated from that cylinder sitting squeezed between your lips. They shot down your throat as a tiny fusillade of acrid fuming things.

Like they were bullets taking slowest pace, that could find the lungs but not the brain. Having chosen to make their home instead in a colony established for the wilting of your airways.

It's like a flower in love with herbicide. Like not sleeping right the night before your morning drives. Like enamourment at worst sight instead of first. What a stupid ironic way to bite the dirt.

If suicide, I'd rather you paint the walls with brain than this humid air with cigarettes.  
I don't think that I could bear to watch. So have a nice life, or something in that vein.  
It's like how a foreign body needs surgery, buddy, you're so fucking foreign to me,  
And the excision might just briefly hurt, but down the line it'll save me so much pain.

Hurts more to fester from the inside out than take a bullet to your head. A quiet removal of the frontal lobe or maybe a more prone to failure segment of your brain.

Lead leaves a single exit wound, but this habit leaves a million that hollow you into an empty shell. And the worst of all is Kayle, I can taste your slow descent to death clinging on your breath.
