Chaos Swan: The Symbol For Desynchronisation

(It's Not A Person, It's A Clich√©)

She asked me why the leitmotif,
Was the constellation cygnus,
I told her it sticks to the horizon stiff,
That it's the wrong star to follow.

That there are better options here,
We've got the southern cross or orion's belt,
But the gorgeous swan is so unclear,
Muddied in the sky-rim streetlights.

"So it's something pretty that isn't so?
A place you want so badly to be,
But somewhere you could never go?"
