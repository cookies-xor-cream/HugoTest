Chaos Swan: The Symbol For Desynchronisation

She asked me why the leitmotif,  
was the constellation cygnus,  
I told her it sticks to the horizon stiff,  
that it's the wrong star to follow.

but the gorgeous swan is so unclear,  
muddied in the sky-rim streetlights.

A place you want so badly to be,  
but somewhere you could never go?"
