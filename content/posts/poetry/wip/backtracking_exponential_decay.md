Powers of a half, half of us half had the power

The orchid was in bloom,  
through an eightball ket,  
and a quarter filled balloon,  
weighing down half a heavy heart,  
for the single one of us  
that wished he were apart.

Our exponent equalled to zero,  
is my final goal and mark,  
I want us to equal each other,  
for the quotient not to let  
its components part.
