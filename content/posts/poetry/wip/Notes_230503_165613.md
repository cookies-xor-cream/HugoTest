"So, I came across a funny idea the other week. And at your risk, I wanted to share it".  
I continued, having received a worried nod,  
"The proof in blame for a murder is a haunting. Not a transient haunting, but one that stick, and can't be shaken off. I've only really been haunted by the living. But your new boyfriend (or whatever you call him), he is haunted. And so are you",  
'You're not impaling that--',  
"It's not your fault, you just feel that it is. And he feels that his fate was his doing as well. I know I'm a broken record but everyone's just ships in the night. It's so rare that ever a circuit complete",  
'She never bridged the wires and shorted your's?',  
"You're asking the wrong questions. It's not whether I was happy two lives ago. It's when I learned I wasn't important. When I actually freed myself from this shitty solipsism",  
'When, as opposed to if, or whether?',  
"There's things that an important person can't survive, not without shedding self-importance. And I'm no gambler but I'd wager that you're due for a volume of such anyday".
