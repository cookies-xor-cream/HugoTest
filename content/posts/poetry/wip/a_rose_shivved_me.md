Can't smell this rose if it wilts in my hand,  
Or make concessions for where it chooses to land,  
My dorsum' is hostage to a punctured-through palm,  
Substituting violence in place of my calm.

So an emergency surgery has now been planned,  
Digging at the thorn that's stuck deep in my hand,  
I can see as it coils the entire way through,  
Wouldn't've been able to operate in the absence of you.

I've got a glass full of whiskey to shrug off the shake,  
To dispel the tremor I get when I see my skin break,  
And I'm on a six hour call, my phone loose on my face,  
With the captive assistant as I return this thorn to a vase.
