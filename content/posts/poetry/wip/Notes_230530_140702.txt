The Winter's Bite Is Not Made Of Ice But Of Three Months Passage

The racehorse runs with blinder on, an  
Emjambing pathway through a life,  
I know I overuse that word, but it's on  
My mind like it's in action on my breath.  
Inhaled within and forged into my essence  
Till my death.

Sawed to dust, then to set to sail, and sunk  
At sea, then set apart, chronically,  
Repeatedly, it's reserved for me,  
Reclaimed from out it's death.  
Pried out of my each receding breath.

Know that I'm not here without a reason,  
Can't be kept at bay or stay within the  
confines of this season, for if you  
succumb to the winter's tactful frosty shiver,  
I could never beckon you to hither my little sinner.

Picked up from the gusts and gales  
That blow out west, and then go stale,  
Im here with you if you're with me but  
Violent weather is all we'll ever be.
