The Electrochemistry Of An Action Potential

Sat in your Toyota, you pointed to a planet, mistaking Venus for a star,
I loved to watch you stargaze through the busted headlights of your car,
And I'd write something of starlight but we can hardly see the sparkle,
It's all faded in fluorescence, in your highbeam's jaundice-yellow funnels.

And so I'll feed your car a pill that we really should've taken,
It's lithium from batteries, because lead isn't quite as proven,
But I'll prove to you if we dull ourselves, half both of our IQs,
Then we'd finally be happy, and I would be happy besides you.

Because all we need are pills to make our reaction go dead quiet,
We're in a steady state of an equilibrial hypomanic riot,
Stuck still in a calm eternity of a forever stuck in flux,
We'll reduce ourselves to chemicals, turn it positive, call it redox.

For when I brushed your hand I only felt the static crackle on the plastic of you skin,
I hope I was something more to you than an action, or an impulse, or an electron sink.
