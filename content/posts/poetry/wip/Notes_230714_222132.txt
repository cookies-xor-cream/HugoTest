Death's Must Be A Stimultant: A Coffee Sapling Funeral Plant

Eight hours a day for thrice each week,
I'm plagued by the curse of sitting still,
But I'm only perfectly fallen into place when
I'm not stuck married to a single space.

I need to walk, but I'm not able to explain,
Why missing me this option's so much pain,
My sisyphean pedestrianism's analgesia's
A walking NMDA agonism's antianaesthesia.
