title: 'First Day Back At Work And Someone Commented On My Scar'

I wiled away the morning crying, stuck between a hard place and a screen,  
I swear to god if the backlight held a candle, you'd see its frayed seams.

You can still see the vestige of the stitching where the flower perforated,  
My hand still feels so fucking hollow sometimes, like it's got no blood in it.

I got a dead girl's souvenir stitched as a scar, blossomed in a rosy bloom of skin,  
I've got a box of old shit from a wanna-be romantic who's twice as sweet as me.

I think it's a little strange how drastic this change exhibits to nullity from pain,  
The way that nature overcompensates by playing with the chemistry of my brain.
