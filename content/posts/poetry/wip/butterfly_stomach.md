I stood there gargling on the taste of blood,  
Staring at her consoling her shaky jolted wrists,  
She was blurry behind the acrylic frosted-glass,  
Like watching a butterfly behind a window screen.

I suppose there's a hole found in the panel,  
Because somehow she had reached right through,  
Stretched to slap me me full-force on the face,  
To stick larvae in my mouth long now overdue.
