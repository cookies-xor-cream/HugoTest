Autoeulogy

Every eulogy I wrote this week,  
came out fucking wrong,  
it's weird that you like this one,  
I thought it was way too long.

"There isn't any meaning,  
you must struggle just for being,  
and thus we conclude existence  
is nothing short of wanton.

I really do want her to stay,  
but I'd rather see her go,  
to spare the last of atrophy,  
to preserve that pasty glow.

So angel when you've landed,  
send me news of your arrival,  
and I'll accept the phone-call charges,  
of a ring from heaven's gate.

I'll leave the nightlight on,  
and I'll write you one more letter,  
but whatever I could say,  
I know you could've said it better".
