Autoeulogy

To live well and to die well are different things entirely. I think you are the epitome of that distinction.

To not tell your boyfriend of a year you were terminal, and then to break up with him over a joke I made (that I can't even remember)? How is that anything shy of insane.

You told your mother why you decided to do it, as if that woman didn't hate me enough.

Every eulogy I wrote this week,
Came out fucking wrong,
It's weird that you like this one,
I thought it was way too long.

"There isn't any meaning,
You must struggle just for being,
And thus we conclude existence
Is nothing short of wanton.

I really do want her to stay,
But I'd rather see her go,
To spare the last of atrophy,
To preserve that pasty glow.

So angel when you've landed,
Send me news of your arrival,
And I'll accept the charges,
Of a call from heaven's gate.

I'll leave the nightlight on,
I'll write you one more letter,
But whatever I could say,
You could say it better".
