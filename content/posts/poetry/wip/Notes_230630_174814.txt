Suicidal Ideation: A Snapshot Of Her Mental State (T Minus A Couple Weeks)

---

There was never a plan.
I know, because if there was,
You'd surely be in it.

---

Comfort in that there are those more hopeless than I,
Comfort in the machinations and schematics I've spied,
Comfort in that there laid bestowed chances for goodbyes,
Comfort in that you persist, however derelict.
However gone awry.

Comfort in dilapidation,
Comfort in embers,
Comfort in ashes, and
Comfort in tempers --
However short --
Comfort in the
Nullification of remorse.

We played our part,
We sailed our course,
We ground the earth,
However coarse.

And though you walk,
You never shift,
With the same conviction,
That I persist.

Meet me where
The ether fades,
Meet me in the
Blue and gray.

Meet me where
The twilight lasts,
Meet me where
In stone it's cast.

Meet me where
It takes a rope
Hanging above
To climb below.

I go from whenst
The crow can't fly,
I come from whenst
We've lost our time.

Take my time.
For only time
Could be so cruel,
To in my soma
Not shelter you.
