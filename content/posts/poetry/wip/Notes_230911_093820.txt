I feel strung out, and hung out to dry,
Denying the gift of a departure's goodbye,
But I'm caught here in poor company,
And I wish that this blind girl could clearly see.

But she was born not knowing light,
Dreaming of migraines that birthed from sight,
That she could never try to feel,
Her optic nerve's wood when it should be made of steel.

So won't you pour her a taller, darker glass,
Tell her this nightmare is due to one day pass.
Won't you close out this joke of a final act,
Give her a swan song, fastest fade to black.

I guess that you had too much whiskey,
For you asked me about Kat.
