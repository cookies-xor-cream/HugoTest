The Blind Can Still Hear A Curtain Call

I feel strung out and hung out to dry,
Denying the gift of departure's goodbye,
But I'm caught here in this poor company,
And I wish that this blind girl could clearly see.

But she was born not knowing light,
Dreaming of migraines that birthed from sight,
That she could never try to feel,
Her optic nerve's wood when it should be steel.

So won't you pour her a taller, thicker, darker glass,
Tell her this nightmare will be due to one day pass.
Won't you close out this joke that is the final act,
Give her a swan song, give her the fastest fade to black.
