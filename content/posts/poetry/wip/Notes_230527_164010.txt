"Keep The Jacket, To Cover The Marks, It's Of No Souvenir To Me"

"She destroyed the book,  
and scorched the pages,  
she shredded all her memories,  
and ripped up all her pictures.

And so that jacket now,  
is all that we have left:  
the last piece of her  
remnant in this place.

And I'm flattered that  
you'd offer it to me.  
but I'm so anaemic  
that I can't afford to bleed.

It's funny how it don't  
make you feel a thing,  
but to wrap me in it, well,  
that's a different thing.  
To give it to me, well,  
that's a deeper sting".
