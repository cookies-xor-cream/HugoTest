The Fossils That Find Life Anew Never Die (Of Embarassment)

I woke up, found tangled in verdant evergreenery  
Of your arms in the sleeves of the hoodie that you stole from me,  
I was trapped by your posture of a bird stuck in sediment,  
The fossil of a friend (of Beck) inscribed in her infinite lament.

You were sleeping sprawled out on the wrong side of your bed,  
I looked over to see somewhere in your dreams you had lost your shirt,  
I woke you up, you scrambled in an embarrassment to get dressed,  
Screaming at me to find your clothes whilst your hands plastered on your chest.
