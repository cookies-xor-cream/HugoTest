Hazel sat in waiting, smoking on the hood,
she saw me flitter in the distance,
so came up with her palms held high,
she was expecting some resistance.

Told me that she wouldn't touch a hair,
told me that no one here would ever hear her wail,
so whatever that she might've tried,
would come with a price when she might fail tonight.

I told her I wasn't scared,
I commanded her to ease,
I stepped onto the grass,
and claimed to her, "I come in peace".

She told me she can't help herself,
that she saw me on the street,
and convinced herself to follow me,
for a single final meet.

She asked me for a story,
she asked me for a history,
she didn't want to fly from here,
with her baggage filled with mystery.

So I started at the start,
on the condition that she leaves,
coz, Marlene, with you, there's
no more courage left to steal.

She was happy I recalled,
that I remembered her real name,
but what's there in a name?
She's the same girl either way.

She held onto that fixation,
so it interleaved into what I had to say,
I talked about the life I passed,
every daydream that I never had.

And when the sun rose on the hill,
she intertwined our fingers,
said, "just as friends, I swear,
I wouldn't dare to pull this trigger".

And there was some comfort in the thought,
that my telling could have reached her,
coz it had been at least an hour,
since she played with the ring on her pointer finger.

And I knew that we were done,
so I got up, and I prepared to part,
but she wrapped me in embrace so tight,
that I swear to god, I could hear her heart.

She told me to stand tall,
said that she was deeply sorry,
to be the footnote in a paragraph,
for such an awful story.

And I told her we broke even,
I wiped her last conclusive leaking tear,
and she offered me a ride,
but I told her that I'd walk from here.

And she seemed a tinge distraught,
I suppose that it's a heavy tale,
and it took a decade to not relive it,
for this story to turn stale.

But it was fresh inside her head,
creviced in the annals of her mind,
shedding fibres like a rope,
that lacked the tension for a bind.

Why do I feel like I have tethered her,
when I broke the shackles, set her loose,
why do I feel like my monologue,
was a flare strapped fast onto a fuse?

So stuck inside that thought,
I thought it only fair to ask,
but when I did she made it canon,
by removing both her hands.

She told me that she saw me,
and she told me that she cared,
then she said, "I'll stay away,
no matter how it is that you might fare".

This was the chance that I was hoping for,
to tie up each loose end,
looks like the road was always straight,
I was hallucinating bends.

This was my final cadence,
of this out of place confession,
and I thought it would've shattered me,
but we avoided my recession.

Because reliving all that time,
and redrawing all those lines,
is something that used to leave me feeling
anything but fine.
