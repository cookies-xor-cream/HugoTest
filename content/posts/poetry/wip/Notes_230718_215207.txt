"Get your hand out of my hair,
I must look like a fucking mess,
Plus, anyways, you're also
Bleeding on my face.

[...]

Wait, no. put it back, it seems
Your pocket's the lesser place".

Waltz Of The Ventriloquist

There's no person or thing I meet past 9pm
who has remotely close to enough evidence,
to convince me that they're really real,
that I'm really sharing in their prescence.

I don't need reality, instead I choose to do better,
I just let it happen, I just let the moment pass,
but every once a while they leave me marked,
it's a shame these scars will never last.

I swear the entirety of my having been,
is classified as 'suspicious circumstance',
too many things fall into place,
like's it's a deliberately orchestrated cosmic dance.
