"Oh my god. The view from up here...
maybe it's the bottle of 'whatever the fuck' we shared now talking,
but if I met the pavement alone in free-fall,
I would treasure every inch of air that we would catch
on the way down".

I wish I remembered the building,
because the skyline blazed into our eyelines,
as if the carcass of a sun enslaved,
and locked up its crime of arsony,
dimmed, and then depraved.

I'm sorry that I opened the closet,
I'm sorry you made me resent you,
I'm sorry that I dug up the body,
I'm sorry for what you'd do without me.

I'm sorry I don't laugh at the right times,
I'm sorry that I'm crossing the wrong lines,
I'm sorry I asked how you got the key card,
I'm sorry I gotta make this so damn hard.

I'm sorry we're drinking on the roof,
I'm sorry if you're faded and aloof,
I'm sorry but I needed the truth,
I'm sorry the alcohol's the proof.
