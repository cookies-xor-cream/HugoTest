My heart stood still, basked in the image,
of her straddling off the windowsill,
sitting in the delicate, and dismal visage.
I think I told her "jump?", but she put something in my drink.
so I don't recall enough,
and lost the patience to clearly think.

I could live on this ledge forever,
but I'd sooner sever every tie,
between my pinhole camera vision,
and the asphalt in her eyes.
