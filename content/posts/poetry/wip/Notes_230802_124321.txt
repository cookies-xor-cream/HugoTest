God better sleep with open eyes,
We sent a spectre in an angel's guise,
Up to heaven to slit his throats,
Her sins are heavy but her spirit still can float.

Then afterwards the branches at my feet,
Will all start to vertically recede,
Coz there's nothing worth it up above,
That hangs anywhere remotely within our reach.

And each by withered each,
The branches will all concede,
Unmake like an anti-icarus,
Victim to the seaside foam and steam.

And maybe on their tumble down,
Before the wood begins to drown,
They will catch a fish, a bream,
A souvenired exit from the breach.

Coz I don't know what phantoms need,
But I postulate that they too need to eat,
Or at the very least that's how it seems to me,
Coz Amber tells me they feed oh misery.
