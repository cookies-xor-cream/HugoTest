I have bruises on my palm from using these stupid sticks,
They're supposed to help me walk, but the best I can do is limp,
Wish that they came a little taller, that they hsd something in my height,
Maybe then my hands wouldn't feel this blunted gnashing bite.

But either way I suppose they were as good as for which I had need,
Because I'm in the park on the phone, listening to you speak,
