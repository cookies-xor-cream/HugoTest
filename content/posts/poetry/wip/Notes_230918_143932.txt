To Shine Is To Kill The Twilight

I'll rename you Lucine or Celestine,
Some title fitting of a lunar thing,
A radiant, stellar, beaming light,
A placid corruption that poisons night.

And tell me, my petra in the sky,
Does air thin out way up that high?
For it always knocks me out of flight,
Into a comet running from a tail inbound.
