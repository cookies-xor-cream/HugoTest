I'd Upload Myself Into A Parrot If History Happened Differently

So Euph, I know how this will sound,
But I intend to stick around,
Know none have cause to spread their wings
Until they're in the ground.

It's a hazard to have a parrot,
For we'll teach it how to speak
And there'd be nothing but enjambments,
All jamming up his beak.

It'll be a quiet second set,
And an even quieter reprive,
Like an introductory class
To expressing human grief.

I'll recount him the apocalypse,
Narrate the history that we left,
And the bird would then repeat me,
In a vulgar sonic theft.

He gets phonetics, not semantics,
Like a feathered mp3
He's a casket-bound cassette with wings,
And it's all he'll ever be.

It's like uploading all my dialogue,
So could you download back the words,
Past death's attempt to shut me up
I would never go unheard.

So I'd force-feed him all my sentences,
Keep his larynx nice and warm,
Such that maybe you could speak to me,
Long after I am gone.

And I'd miss you, I'd be buried,
Way too deep to hear your voice,
But I'd die happy fully knowing
That that problem isn't yours
