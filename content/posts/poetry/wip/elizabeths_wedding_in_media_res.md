And the last wedding I had skipped,  
is at present day some time ago,  
I pulled every excuse of health, and jealousy,  
fabricating reasons not to go.

So two weeks away from married,  
on her final day free before the wedding,  
Liz was sitting at midnight in her car  
with a rain-drenched teenage me.

I don't recall much of that night,  
except that I hadn't had anything to drink,  
and every time I ask what happened,  
someone picks a fight with me,  
and that makes me overthink.

What is it that you did? I wanted to have known ,  
what pushed away half of your friends,  
what justifies these sideways stares that  
you get everywhere you go?

And I know we couldn't have been alone,  
no I remember distinctly: Amber screaming on the phone.  
she wasn't making sense,  
but she kept wailing at me that I really should just go.

But I think that I stayed put,  
kept Elizabeth good company,  
woke up with a headache ringing,  
like a missed call that I never understood,  
and somehow it is still yet pending.

So tell me Amber, why...  
why would I wake up in your bed?  
and why the fuck did I wake up  
so hungover, fucking halfway dead.

And she was always one for secrets,  
but would tell me what I should know,  
except for, I suppose, this time,  
when she told me I should let it go.

And she took no pause,  
no. She instantly resumed:  
"We're boycotting her wedding,  
and keeping her far away from you".
