God I need a coffee  
in this dying afternoon,  
it's the only substance  
on which I'm dependent,  
and that's not assuming  
that we're excluding you.

Coz abuse is out of question,  
if you're the object of that action,  
since the syntax tree matches  
no regular expressions,  
except for those that make  
the animacy distinction.

I wish that for me  
reflexive was reciprocal,  
but the mirror holds an isomer,  
geometrically deferred.

I'm an enantiomer of myself,  
something that the z axis  
inverted and has since then  
desperately misplaced.

If you draw my resonance diagram,  
you'd see the configuration of my charge,  
oscillating haphazardly,  
between 'not enough' and 'too much'.

I'm the zeroes, she's the infimum,  
and everyone in between is such  
a lonely local minimum,  
a current in this noisy graph of mine.

They're a step of exothermia,  
nudging hyperthermia,  
to the ground state down below,  
but that drop isn't fucking shallow.

If you fall, I would dearly hate to see you go.  
but let's bite the wind between our teeth,  
whichever way it blows.
