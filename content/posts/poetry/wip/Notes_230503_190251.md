When I Walk Here At Night My Chest Hurts A Little: If I Could Summon, Then You'd Be Here  
Thank You For Walking Me Home, Thank You For The Conversation, Thank You For Listening To Everything, Thank You For Acknowledging I'm Not Perfect, Thank You For Acknowledging I Never Claimed Such, Thank You Thank You Thank You Thank You  
She's been stuck in my head since I saw her last,  
Must've been last night, but I can hardly keep track.  
This can't be an encore of what me and Amber had,  
Our calendars are too spangled to live like that.  
I glued myself to my window after,  
Thought I'd be safer from the outside looking in,  
I've got the thread, I've got the vision for a plan,  
And a stare like a pin that I'm keeping at hand.  
I'm gonna watch The Watcher,  
Gonna catch The Catcher,  
And collect The Collector,  
That derelict defector.  
I'll watch her shed her titles,  
And leave me all of mine,  
Whether by murderous inheritance,  
Or found in a domestic flight.  
Either way, she'll leave one of these nights.
