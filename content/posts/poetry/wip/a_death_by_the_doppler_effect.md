You're getting further every day,  
Your light redshifts to infrared,  
But every photon through my head,  
Comes out blue the other way.

This story's so fucking frayed,  
But I'm told that history never tears,  
There'll be another sentence birthed  
For each full stop to mark a grave.

I love these wild off-hand remarks,  
Markers for a haphazard reverie,  
Evidence sunlight's bursting at the seams.

Race backwards into dark,  
Recursed infinitely to flee,  
And then I will wake up to my dream.
