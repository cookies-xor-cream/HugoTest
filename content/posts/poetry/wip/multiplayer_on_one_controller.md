She handed Steph a set of polaroids,  
They're of her enamoured by her boy,  
And him playing with her hair.

She thought that I might like these pictures,  
Though she knew that I'd prefer  
A snapshot of her sutures and lacerations.

She said that she would let me see in person,  
Some time in the far-off distant future,  
But it seems we'll never reach that day.

This is a co-op game and it looks like  
We're down by a single player today,  
(The other one went on short notice,  
On a permanent visit to a far too shallow grave).
