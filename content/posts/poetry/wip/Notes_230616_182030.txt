Every Look Hurts

If I could stick a pin to prick,
And fasten deep into your skin,
Then I would run the thread in lieu
Of scarlet lines all drawn to you.

They'd replace the lasersights,
That scoped rifle that you call eyes,

The zoom is far too harsh for me,
Every glance just makes me bleed
in vain.

I am nothing but a frankensteining,
an amalgamation of my pain.
