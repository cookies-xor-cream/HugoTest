The More Of It I Read, The More I Understand Why You Loved And Hated It

I think I do too, so I needed a different story to dilute it.

And thus I read a book about taking time and distance (don't think anyone else would agree on those themes).

How can half the globe feel like too little space?
How can forever feel like too little time?

She's more of myself,
Than I could hope to have been,
Whatever souls are comprised of,
Doubled for us, as only we gleam.

She read a book about revenge,
Now she's got an edge on her heart,
So when it gets closer to mine,
It makes the bleeding restart.

Then she'll salt all the wounds,
To keep the infection at bay,
It was gonna go septic,
But now I guess that I'm safe.

And if one comes to die,
Then the other will know,
Who untethered the coil,
And dealt them the blow.

I'd write you down for a decade,
I will tether you back,
Attach you so firmly to my
Mortal coil that you lack.
