I told her to go home,  
that is was raining,  
she didn't respond,  
she wasn't there.

I was talking to  
the outline of a shadow,  
a silhouette stuck  
like a ghost trapped in the tree-line.

I think it's time that I stop visiting this place.
to let this rain wash the sullen grimace off my face.

To let the sprinklers in redundancy,  
just wipe the expression off me clean.

To gift to me, in faith well-found,  
a fresh slate, been blanked anew,  
that holds onto its gleam,  
from when it still found it was new.

She told me that she noticed  
that she'd conceived  
with her bleeding  
four weeks late.

That Amber gripped her hands,  
and held her in a symphony,  
as she sung that it was  
all gonna turn out just okay.

You're not him,  
but you're not better.  
I tore up inside,  
as I tore up all your letters.

A homewrecker in disguise.  
like the spirit of the ibis  
that's migrating from  
the Nile.

I think it must be time.  
I think that I must leave.  
there's no memories left  
that I could even try to want to steal.
