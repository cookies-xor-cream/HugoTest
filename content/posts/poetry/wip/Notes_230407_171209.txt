Hannah And Amber Are The Analysis Everybody Needs When They're Impartial

They're Not Impartial

I asked her for her thoughts,
An explanation as to 'why',
Coz she always answered that best,
But I'll still trust Amber with the 'what'.

"It's a recoil, it's the ricochet,
Reflactance replacing refraction,
Substitution substituting displacement,
An action masquerading as inaction".

She then proceeded to explain how 'Hazel' filled in the missing pieces of the puzzle.

That 'nothing' and 'potentially anything' may as well be a syllable apart (and I'll forget her in less than a month).

That her from the park, and her on the phone, were the anchronisms I would never take home (I wouldn't take her homeâ€½)

"You still have blood in your heart so don't chip at the stone,
didn't take a day to mix the cement to build rome".
