My Literal Crutches

My whole life I've been living crutch to fucking crutch, now I sprained my ankle to finally get a pair,
I tried to convince myself that two legs is one too much, but I miss the walks after a measly goddamn day.
I find it ironic how this shattered bone inside my joint is the only damage that I will see repaired,
For the damage in my head has found its wretched home and it is here, it has made its place to stay.
