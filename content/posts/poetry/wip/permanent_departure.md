In the absence of your union  
you say the solution's dissolution,  
but I'm disillusioned by the hue,  
of the rampant purple runway,  
bruising up and down through you.

And if we can't fix an exit,  
then we'll stay in and we'll sit,  
we'll get Danish butter biscuits,  
count the minutes spent in illness,  
till the time stamped on your ticket.

Coz I'm in it for the finish we expect,  
not the one we played-pretend,  
not the one that we'd rehearse,  
so however it might end,  
you'll find me at the final bend.

And when nothing else can matter,  
we know reality has shattered,  
when we're both as mad as hatters,  
we'll give chatter to the reaper,  
so go on up and greet her.

We're in her fanclub, retroactive,  
though we're scarcely Abrahamic,  
and I know I'll one day meet her,  
but it's your turn, now be seated,  
enjoy the flight.

We booked out the whole damn aisle,  
So you're sitting alone, on the window-side,   
Where you can hide, and dream of home,  
Good night, I'll see you never, you'll see me soon.
