Friends Are The Best Handcuffs
Love Is A Hell Of A Prison

You have got a penny a thought on the boundless emphatics,
Double it for the bounds of the binds, strung in wires on our wrists,
Like shackles that found themselves conscripted, enlisted,
Then discovered through the bruises' persistence, still we resisted.

If I was to redraw schematics for our handcuffs from scratch,
I'd give them a thumb in the place of their latch,
For whatever trapping resides in that mechanical snatch,
Is eclipsed by the gravity in the brush of your hands.
(And the feelings we catch?)
