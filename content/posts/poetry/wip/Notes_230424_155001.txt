My Eyes Are A Trapdoor To Nowhere At All
But A Well In The Prescence Of Smoke

I had a dream I couldn't dream,
In a waking nightmare that I couldn't
Clearly seem to see.

I took a breath I couldn't draw,
In the summer air and bushfire smoke,
My gullet was dried raw.

I gave a look, but couldn't see,
The pages falling out the binds,
Slipping out the seams, disguised,
Only to meet the fire.

I had a nightmare in a dream,
That I wish that I could reel,
But when granted it these crimson skies
Was all that I could seem to catch,
Inside my teary eyes.
