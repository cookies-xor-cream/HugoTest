My Eyes Are A Trapdoor To A Well

I had a dream I couldn't dream,
in a waking nightmare that I couldn't
seem to clearly see.

I took a breath I couldn't draw,
un the summer air and bushfire smoke,
my gullet was dried raw.

I gave a look, but couldn't see,
the pages falling out the binds,
slipping out the seams, disguised,
only to meet the fire.

I had a nightmare in a dream,
that I wish that I could reel,
but when granted it, these crimson skies
were all that I could seem to catch,
inside my teary eyes.
