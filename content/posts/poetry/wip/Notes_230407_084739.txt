Repeat; Repeat; Repeat; Repeat (I Aimed To Love The City; But Found Collateral)

Fuck the tunnel of white,
The light I want at the end,
Is the rosy beaming afterglow,
From the tail light of her car.

And I know that I should ease in,
That I should be shielding my eyes,
But I don't care, no I'm going to
Stare straight into that fire.

If it's between that picture,
And the sprawling city lights,
I would always pick the former,
Coz I fell for it so hard.

Tell me my vision's broken,
Twice as skewing as my thoughts,
But I won't listen to a word,
No, I need to play this part.
