I'm On The West Coast, But You're On The Western-Most Coast From Me

Rummage through the scraps that you left,
Feels like graverobbing, feels like a ghost
Caught me on the windowsill
And charged a tarrif for the theft.

I'll trade your memories for the parts,
Of the reboot that I need
For clean slate, and restart,
To part from the salty air that you breathe.

Because the year we spent apart,
Is downwardly displaced,
From the lump in my throat,
To settle as dregs in my heart.

The dead-end of a no-through road,
A cul-de-sac that pulled out your sleeve,
To reveal a losing hand and a misplaced
Deck of cards that you tried so hard to steal.
