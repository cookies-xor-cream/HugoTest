If There Wasn't 13.7 Billion Years Of Evidence I Would So Quickly Believe That She Created The Universe (But I Am Still Convinced Her Absence Will Destroy It And I Want To Record Its Death)

"What are you two doing?"

"Pair programming?"

"Stop flirting for fuck's sake"

Reciting free verse and spoken word I swear to god we've once before rehearsed, for she's closing every clause with no stutter and zero fucking pause.

She knows the end to every thought. If I'm aspiration, then she's the fucking cough. If I'm pneumonia, then she's alveolar blood. If I'm deistic theism, then she's the only god. If I'm catching fire, then she's F451. And if I'm imperial, then she's my frozen brine.

Like saccharine protein and the Maillard reaction, like target prioritisation and the choice of bolt action. Like a button-up fraying at the slits, like a rosary used praying in stints of gossip.

Like a rope made of dress or robe in a hangman's knot. Like the hope in your eyes as marker for a war well-fought (but aptly lost).

Whether death at his hand or by suicide, there's no wayside left with me. It's high tide till the end of night. So drop hanging or a death by drowning, when your oxygen drops I'll be there with a timer waiting, counting.
