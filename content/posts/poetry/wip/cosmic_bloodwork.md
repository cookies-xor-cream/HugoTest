"If the universe had a vascular system, you'd be the jugular and I'd be the ulnar"

"You know, I never thought I'd need textbooks to get hit on"

Stars are exit wounds, leaking from capillaries. And comets are still-bleeding punctures in a vein.

Though your eyes sparkle so much brighter, the flow of blood on a cosmic scale lasts longer.

That sparkle in your iris, and reflection on the black between's a flood of ichor from a butchered artery.

We cut reality too deep, and the starlight of your stare spilled through the stitching to burst the frayed seams.
