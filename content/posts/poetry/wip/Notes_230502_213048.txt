15 Years Rewind: Writing For The Plot

I asked her if she thinks I've grown or changed,
And I got her 2 cents but I've so much more in my pockets than some loose change.

I think the starkest contrast between me now and me then,
Is that I don't flinch, that I'm willing to dredge through pain.

It was a weird couple weeks, back from the doctor's,
I kept quiet like a muzzled hound, just as I'd been ordered.

But felt more feline than canine, I was unkindred at home,
So I slipped out my shackles and was free then to roam.

The gemstone came to visit me, felt sticky to the touch,
Not now but throughout history, if you jumped back far enough.

But if you could jump back, I would've taken a car crash
Out the calculation, simplified the computation.

But I wouldn't anymore,
Oh, what would it be all for?

And if you answer 'for me',
I'm gonna hit you on your head in heaven,
Coz I've shed a decade alive,
A handful of years more than you ever survived.
