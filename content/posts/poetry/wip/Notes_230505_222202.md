The Plateau Of Complacency

I learned that less was more,
When I found out that everything,
Was really nothing less,
Than nothing at fucking all.

So I dont have the pictures,
And I don't have the volumes,
I shed the last of the canon,
When we burned up all the lore.

And when you asked me
What it's for, I couldn't quite
Answer you directly,
Just shrugged in hesitation.

There's nothing in this binder,
That'll ever see resuscitation,
But there would be results
That we could maybe chase.

"If only sweetie, you weren't such a chaste",
'You know I only would only ever want a taste',
"If your hunger need not satiate, what is it then for?",
'Used to be for everything, but now it's for nothing anymore'.
