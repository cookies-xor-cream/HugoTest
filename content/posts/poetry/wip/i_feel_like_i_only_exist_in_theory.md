You lost your turn of phrase,  
In the disjointed staccato  
Slurring of words  
That you never said.

You lost all of your charm,  
In the chasm of every  
Final sentence that we  
Forgot that we had lost.

Legato, brought along,  
Dragged around in a
Quiet destiny, stuck strung  
Throughout the mud.

Isolated, episodic,  
Like a stone skipping,  
Quietly on slowly  
Curdled boiling blood.

If I crank the heating,  
Will you fall out of this  
Dismal feeling  
You've been hosting?

If hell freezes over  
Will you feel the frost  
Slowly creeping  
On each and every final word  
That I've been speaking?

Will you feel this heatwave beaten,  
In icy sentiment, as it sits  
Quietly receded?
