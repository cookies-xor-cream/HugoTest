Today's Calendar Event: A Thursday Like Ice To The Touch

Saw a reel a while back.
It said if I died, you should take the week off.
It's funny how I don't follow my own advice.

I would've written something of actual fucking substance here, but I don't have it in me.

I suppose it's good we didn't wait till post-mortem to write your eulogy, huh?
