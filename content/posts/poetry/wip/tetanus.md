She told me to just "sleep it off"  
I asked her what she meant exactly,  
and she said she means everything,  
and said it so fucking nonchalantly.

"Sweetheart, I'm not gonna die,  
I think it's high time that we clarify,  
to feel this way, it ain't alright",

But my ramblings were only  
a dulled and muffled noise.  
the sounds I made were  
nothing more than the empty  
droning of an empty voice.

The buzz rang like  
tinnitus met tetanus  
in causation.

Like a rusty nail  
and a cochlear  
marriage's perforation.
