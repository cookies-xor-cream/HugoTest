Succumbing To The Miracle Of Headache Debt

I walked to ParÄ«sa's coz I had a dream Where I did. And it turns out I remember the route.

Her kid has got so much bigger. It was nice to stare at the ceiling with someone between marking papers.

I can try my best to hold this posture
Just long enough not to shatter glass,
But please don't show me the flash,
Im not sure I can make this miracle last.

There's still a black smear on my eyes,
From when I looked at the eclipse,
And I think I burned through my being,
But im more concerned with my wrists.

Because my bones have been fusing,
Stuck permanently concatenating,
Four to two to one to none,
Slowly sinking, quickly wrinkling,
In time.
