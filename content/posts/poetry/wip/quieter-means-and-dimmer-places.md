My heart's not climbing up my gullet,  
and my head doesn't harbour hurt,  
I'm not looking for someone,  
to sit with me out on the curb.

Think after eight hours of reading  
through legislature,  
this is what I needed:  
a full blown sensory recession.

Even though this room's got  
an abundance of fluorescent light,  
my eyes are rested well enough,  
to withstand the photons as they bite.
