    Anxiolytics:  
    Sanity Is A Place Between Stuttering And Forgetting  
date: 2023-03-03

They robbed my heartrate and my words  
every sentence I thought to speak  
fell in and through the veil of speech  
that drove my thoughts and varied ticks.

"When'd it start?"  
*"Think I was six".*

"And did the anxiolytics help?"  
*"They squashed my thoughts*  
*and my nervous ticks"*  
"So why claim to me that they did not?"

*"It helps me in the likeness that*  
*you can come to help someone*  
*at knifepoint*  
*in the parking lot."*
