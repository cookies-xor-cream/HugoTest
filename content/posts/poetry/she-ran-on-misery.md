When your words fall short,  
you gotta learn to resort to bolt action,  
coz we're using ferrous rounds but,  
spark a diamagnetic dis-attraction.

*"Would you have spent the night with me,*  
*if I was short an amine group?*  
*you don't have to lie to me.*  
*You know that I can take the truth".*

I lied but wore a good-faith smile,  
And told her what she needs to hear,  
"If you got rid of the chemistry,  
You know you wouldn't find me here".
