The TV is snowing,  
your picture's in the panel,  
coz thinking of you's  
the only movie I can handle.

And I can't help but hope,  
that you're feeling the same,  
that the sole voice in your head's,  
on loop saying my name.

Coz I've begun my descent,  
to this place where I'm roped,  
into thinking only of you,  
I just barely can cope.
