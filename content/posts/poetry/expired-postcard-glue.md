*"So tell me all the things that you can't be,*  
*then I'll fill in the vacancies,*  
*the priest goes reads it all out loud,*  
*as we both nod without a sound.*

*But they're at a wedding with vacant seats,*  
*and each one reads reserved,*  
*oh I guess that it was meant to be,*  
*and it's what they deserved."*

When I got the letter,  
fuck I knew the writing,  
her voice rang loud,  
and the tone was biting.

So I read the thing,  
and I hated liking,  
the turn of phrase,  
and the lack of fighting.

"Oh I know that you hate me too,  
but I'm lacking the hard proof"

So my brain fills in  
the missing details,  
the missing risks,  
and the lacked resistance.

"Can I write you more at all?  
Or will you curse me till I'm sore?  
But will you break out of your mold?  
Or does he do as he is told?"

*"I was so wrong but you are too,*  
*so is our blood thinner than postcard glue?"*
