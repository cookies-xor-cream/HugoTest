I had a nightmare in a dream, where Evergreen became a tree,  
and grew to shelter me.

Well, she's not all she seems, but long lost are these  
remnants of my dreams.

Of all the trees I saw, none bloomed in spring,  
to stay through fall.

But if autumn came to steal your shade,  
I wouldn't mourn your leaves, my debt's been paid

Though I might seem to grieve our loss,  
when it's been barely fucking way too long.

And I might come to miss you here,  
your reminders and the memories,  
they've faded with the years.

And I'll forget your friends,  
but not the sharp remarks at stutter-speed,  
that found me cut and pierced.

I didn't grow these empty lungs,  
so I could drown upon the ground,  
where my gills can't touch my tongue.

So come and grab a cup then stay,  
and while with me the night away.

I swear I'll hold the autumn dear,  
dread the summer heat so far from here.  
But we didn't fix your clock.

I forgot to buy the screws,  
and that forms a single final block.

The first one was your mum,  
who's trapped in time and chugging rum,  
wish I'd never caught him cheat.

I'd dodge these exothermic fights,  
that buried me in the heat.

And we won't frame the shot,  
coz the shooting is a waste of time  
we'll keep the film and fall back on  
the blurry pictures in our heads.

But I won't blame you then,  
as I still don't blame you now,  
due to my retrograde amnesia  
of a retroactive fight.

But I won't pick apart the corpse,  
how fruitful it may seem.  
Since the only thing that's left of you,  
is a nightmare in a dream.

I had a nightmare in my dream,  
that Evergreen became a tree,  
and never came to wither me.

I had a nightmare in a dream,  
that Evergreen was ivy wrapped,  
but we both know that  
that's a load of crap.

Like a live rabbit in a hat.  
That turned out to be nothing more,  
Than the cadaver of a rat.
