Non ho finirlo; ma Ã¨ finito

I feel I'm more herself than I,  
in my forging, the divine  
left a picture of her sleeping  
sewn straight into my eyes.

She's more myself than I,  
in her creation, my causation,  
something from deep within my essence  
had found her's and went awry.

She's more herself than I,  
and the soul within my burning,  
like a cauldron: boiling, churning,  
found its sentiment returning,  
for an ultimate goodbye.

I'm more myself than I,  
in the fusion of our confusion,  
in the fracture of my intrusion,  
my words find their protrusions,  
lain without any ears or eyes.

The morning break of Amber light,  
is more stellar than the sunlight,  
like the essence of a bomb,  
that fuses in the fissure,  
of a final farewell song.

I'm more myself disguised,  
like the streetlamp sitting patient,  
all the pain within me latent,  
found a pattern for a torment,  
that a passer-by lays dormant,  
calling to the night.

I'm less my rights than wrongs,  
I'm less my breath than lungs,  
I'm less my steps than rungs,  
I'm less my words than tongues.

It's been too long,  
It's been too long,  
It's been too long,  
It's been too long.
