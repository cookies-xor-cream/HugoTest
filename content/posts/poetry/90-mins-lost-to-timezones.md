Butterflies with tattered wings  
are you ones who fight but fail submit,  
applications with deadlines due.  
They'd be on time if you are too.

The difference is an hour halved    
from the Eastern cusp of desert sands.  
Geotemporal spacetime shifts  
Can sunder us with half filled rifts.

We've got a half an hour come between  
the sands and the silica-desert forest screens.
