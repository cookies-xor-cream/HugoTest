title: "Her Eyes Are Bottomless: I Could Drown..."

The pins and needles drowned me fast,  
the joy was torrenting my heart,  
from lungs to pulmonary arteries,  
my blood caught air it won't discard.

Coz I'm breathing in twice as much,  
as I can even try exhale,  
it rained on us, but somewhere deep,  
my heart was wishing for some hail.

Something to whisk us both away,  
to take us from almost alone,  
to having more cover than company,  
under the shelter of your home.

Your eyes are empty, catching rain,  
let me drown in them, I would die at peace,  
on the mangrove, gulch, and muddy fields,  
if I tried not to feel, I've missed my beat.
