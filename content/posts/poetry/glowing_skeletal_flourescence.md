title: Glowing Skeletal Fluorescence

Fluorescence and phosphorescence,  
are my skeleton's iridescent,  
but hers is dull and grainy,  
the bone has lost its sheen firmly.

I hope she's still glowing in UV or IR  
I would hate to watch the shimmer fade

You can pick up the phone,  
or could hang up infused,  
by the rage of my match  
that ran down your fuse.

I know you're a halide away,  
from being coupled and paired,  
packaged with a frame of bones,  
for me to take if I dared.

But I'm not so discrete,  
I'm uncommonly found,  
next to the metals that  
are composing your salts.

Let's try out a blacklight,  
a fluoride-beam lamp.  
Get me some black ink,  
and a lead-weighted stamp.

I'll show you your matchbox,  
and you'll play with the reds,  
we're phosphorescent sweetie,  
we still glow when we're dead.
