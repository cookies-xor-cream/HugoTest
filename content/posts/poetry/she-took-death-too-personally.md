*"Do you really play just that damn deaf,*  
*That you feign you missed what she had said?"*

"You were, maybe, good with her,  
But you're shy with me and I'm eight years  
Shy of rent"

*"You think you know what she would want,*  
*But you are dumb, and blind, and spent.*

*Don't bargain with the things I say,*  
*I said all that I could wish,*  
*and all that I have gravely meant:*  
*So look at me, but there's nothing*  
*left to see".*

She was sitting there,  
All curled up in her book,  
*Dont look, dont look,*  
*Dont look, dont look,*

*Dont look, dont look,*  
***Dont look.***

One look was all  
That it would take,  
If it had ever took.
