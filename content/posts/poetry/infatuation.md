See the tread of the tracks,  
that I leave with my pen,  
my heart's changing its tack,  
as I neighbour 'insane'.

Don't play with my heart,  
I'm a sucker for that,  
I need a shuffle of tarot,  
and you reading my hand.

Instead you're reading my palm,  
I think that you've found,  
a mouthful of psalms,  
and I long for the sound.
