After you've tasted the red, all you can see  
are bloodbags with legs, that are still yet to bleed.

The only difference between a slot machine,  
and the daily decision to keep on breathing,  
is that in the latter you lose everything anyways.  
So just gamble on 'progress' and keep living your best,  
you haven't an inkling control over anything else.
