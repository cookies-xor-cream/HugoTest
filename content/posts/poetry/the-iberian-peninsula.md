    The Iberian Peninsula: What The Fuck Were You Thinking With That Age Gap  
    (She Normalized It For Me?)

__From Amber's Perspective:__  
"The less you speak the more you write,  
but the less you write the less you speak,  
if I didn't know any better, I'd say by  
1994 I would have fucking peaked.

So watch the news, and ink your beak,  
I'll write to you, and you'll respond,  
so please write back if what you write,  
and what you miss just might belong.

Though in my head, it's obvious,  
we'll weather stormy skies,  
been doing it since '94 and  
the only cause is lacked goodbyes.

And I won't even think amuse  
the chance that he might never mail,  
and I need time to think it through,  
so we'll talk to match speed of snails.

I never asked for her ID,  
and when I saw I played pretend,  
that it was something I'd never seen.  
But you were younger, and I'm content.

And if the way you thought of me,  
was the slightest indication to  
the love or lust that she had breathed.  
then that's enough, and I am through".

__From My Perspective:__  
"None of us had a leg to stand on,  
but you had eight years longer.  
And she had three. You never grew up,  
and she had never breathed.

She was seventeen, and never saw  
the gap in age. Just old enough  
for play-pretend to falsely think  
that it sundered from her play-belief.

I don't know, and won't say posthaste  
how I feel post-fact and as of late.  
I will come and I will drop the haste,  
before it comes and grows till hate.

My feelings scatter and undulate".























It tears the line between okay  
And not okay. It's not okay.  
It's not okay. It's not okay.
