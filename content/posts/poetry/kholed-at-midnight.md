Just tell me how you spiked this cup,  
coz that's an offer that I'd take up,  
but don't lie to me, I know that look,  
let's just drink it and we'll find a book.

*"There's nothing there, there never was*  
*don't overplay it, don't make a fuss,*  
*If I'm asleep by Wednesday noon,*  
*the both of us will wake entombed".*

"We've always got to cut a deal,  
always find a way to steal,  
the joy out of each and every day,  
you know what I want to hear you say"

*"Fuck, yes, I guess I'll say okay,*  
*if it's what you want: then please pray tell,*  
*I'll drink it, and we'll roll through mud,*  
*I'll drink it, and we'll sleep through floods.*

*The water's cold and number than*  
*your icy heart and frosty tact*  
*you didn't have to name the kid,*  
*least not post-mortem like you did.*

"You can just say it directly,  
one 'fuck you' that's aptly put,  
to leave me in the river flow,  
abandoned in the salt and soot".

*"I did it so, but you got there first,*  
*it hurt to breath the saline dirt,*  
*but holed or whole and wholely just,*  
*we promptly met this earthly crust.*
