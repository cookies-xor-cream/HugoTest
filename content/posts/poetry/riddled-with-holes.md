I know that you've got ahold of a needle,  
but don't dare poke holes where my hope stows,  
I've a suicide pact: sealed with a straight shot up,  
of an arrow from cupid's stolen bow.

I'm short a thimble, my hope wears thin,  
don't unthread the loomwork I've tried  
so very hard to diligently spin.
