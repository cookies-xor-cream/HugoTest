She read notes she shouldn't read,  
from girls she shouldn't,  
try so fucking hard to breath.

*"Katherine, please, the crap you read,*  
*it's all filling up your empty head,*  
*don't play around with that hollow box*  
*And the fragments of this eldritch dread."*

"We'll take off soon, we'll head to mine,  
since I'm emergency contact one,  
I'll call the shots, I've got your meds,  
got the hypnotics and the seds."

*"Do you really think you're making sense?*  
*She'll hate you now, and forevermore,*  
*you'd have to be so fucking dense*  
*to be the one to take her home."*

"I'm older, I'm with her, and you're besides her,  
I'll keep her chained unto my sight,  
I just want to have layed besides her,  
want to have braved these vacant nights"

*"These vacant nights?! Do you see her state?*  
*the cold is clawing, she's fever-pitched,*  
*if you pick her up off from this bed,*  
*I wouldn't watch it while she gets restitched."*

"I know you will, don't tell these lies,  
I saw the looks, I've watched your eyes,  
if I were you: I'd promptly quit,  
I'd go back home, and idly sit."

I sat at home I'd like to think,  
I don't remember a fucking thing.

But I know I left the wanderlust,  
I'm not the person here I wanted lost.

I hope that you could find your place,  
in that lonely frantic frenzied phase.

I'd never been so wrong before,  
but she was more so, as I foretold.
