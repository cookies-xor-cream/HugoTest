I want a routine, I want a set of steps,  
but I won't meet you for a second time.  
Please don't apologise, you didn't overstep,  
I'm just cycling between the states of matter,  
and I need to take my time.

I swear to you I'm fine,  
but tonight I'm looking for a name,  
that's spelt any way but *'mine'.*
