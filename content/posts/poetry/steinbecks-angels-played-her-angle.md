The grapevines in wrath,  
twist and turn around my hands,  
they think that I don't understand  
to withdraw the anger from my slap.

And I think it's right in fractions  
has omniscience for her infractions,  
but the violence that I choose to use,  
no matter how grave holds no candle  
to her abuse.
