I said hi to you in passing,  
on a day in the dead of summer,  
record it by the sweat I wore  
remembered by the heatwave's strokes.

You said hi back, a sleight of tongue?  
Is this a lapse in judgement spied?  
I said hi, and then hello again,  
you said it back and I knew then:  
that my friend was dead.

Hello, orphan.  
Hello again.
