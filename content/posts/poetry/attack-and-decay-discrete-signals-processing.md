Her eyes, like a pike, ran me through  
the weight of her face drove the spine  
as it skewed.

I got a cut on my face, a dotted redline,  
gaps drawn as reminders of our  
missing time.

A telltale sign, from a telltale heart,  
the look disassembled me, took  
me apart.

Guess I've found myself whisked back,  
spirited away, dreamt away to the start,  
nothing left to do but pray.

But I'm not one for prayer, if I need someone  
I'll ring them up, until the hesitation hits that  
I dont know if they'll pick up.

I just need an attack,  
I need a rising pitch,  
I need the intonation,  
a vector for a flinch.

She came in waves,  
and random noise,  
but frequency space  
saw her transposed.

She's a sawtoothed sweetheart,  
lost in the streetside muddy flood,  
in the open sewers that filled,  
and spilled over with her blood.

She's the attack and decay,  
of every sentiment she stole,  
and every sentence that I  
could never say, and so I never spoke.
