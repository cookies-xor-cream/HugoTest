I always borrow tempered time,  
devoid of anchored stopping-signs,  
I seldom stop for tempo'd brace,  
and speak with blood drawn to my face.

I found a park with tapered sound,  
I walked straight through the thorny greens,  
my feet then met this cockroach'd ground,  
my vocal chords in likeness seamed.

Scream,  
or don't,  
there's no one there.

Wail,  
or don't,  
just rid this air.

Breathe,  
or don't,  
there's better things.

Speak,  
or don't,  
can't break it twice.

Then think  
in spades  
like it's a vice.

If I try to write an apology  
I bet it'll go something like:  
Fuck, fuck, fuck, FUCK,  
I'm sorry.

Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,  
Fuck. Fuck.  
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,  
Im sorry.
