I sleep with my arms crossed  
and my hands entwined,  
ny ulnar nerve's stretched out  
into a zero width line.

I wouldn't call it elastic,  
I don't think that that's quite true,  
it's less like the tire off your cars,  
and more like the sole of your shoes.

But I say to myself,  
like its vulcanised truth,  
that my wrists don't burn,  
and my right arm doesn't shoot.

*"Shooting pain? Ugh,*  
*Wouldn't call it that really".*  
"Then how do you define it  
Please tell me exactly".

*"I sleep wrong;*  
*Please save the talk*  
*Hold your mouth*  
*And tie your tongue".*
