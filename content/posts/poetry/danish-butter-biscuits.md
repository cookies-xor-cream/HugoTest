I pick up every sound I hear,  
it distorts and never stays the same,  
but it always preserves the fear,  
I wish I could tip it over,  
I wish I could unhear.

*"There was a thud and it sticks,*  
*it was loud but so nondescript,*  
*and it buried me in all the sounds*  
*of the shit that came prescript.*

*And I can't shake off the shudder,*  
*those muffled muted screams,*  
*like we're stuck inside a house,*  
*that can't hold a single mouse within its seams.*

*And one of the first things I remember,*  
*is the sound of your mouth crackling,*  
*on danish butter biscuit embers,*  
*that takes the ashes and returns to sender.*

*The next thing breaks the timeline,*  
*like I'm stuck walking on a one-way street,*  
*staring at the wrong-way signs,*  
*but I've skipped each and every beat.*

*I'd let you bloodlet the rest of it*  
*if you choose to let me choose from it,*  
*to save only the greatest bits,*  
*I only want a taste of it.*

*I'd take the red splatter,*  
*I'd take the fabric rip,*  
*as bloody clothing tatters,*  
*but I don't think that it matters.*

*We're a dreg of a girl, a vestige broken,*  
*the lights were too bright,*  
*and if it's any token:*  
*I toggled the ceiling fans.*

*A dozen or two attempts,*  
*that's all it took to find the blades*  
*that undercut the yellow tent,*  
*of light that lost us shelter.*

*They took out the friendly fans,*  
*and overruled the very last,*  
*of our photosensitive plans --*  
*those afterthoughts that wouldn't last."*

*Somewhere between a fire,*  
*and the caustic Tunisian ash,*  
*the forest blaze ignites*  
*and it has come to dance.*

*Well, I'm gonna watch the show,*  
*from my bedroom window's lattice,*  
*as the decaying corpses glow,*  
*in catalyst till they don't exist.*

"Arya, I could tell you what happened.  
I didn't see it but I have heard,  
not the sounds but  
the whispers from the herd."

*"I don't want to know,*  
*and I don't want to make that trade,*  
*I should pack my shit and go.*  
*I never fucking asked to know"*

"It's funny that you're the one,  
who two is too much company for,  
and the only first hand recount,  
begrieving what you forgot you swore."

*"Goodbye Amber, I'm going now,*  
*don't lose me another decade,*  
*but please don't ever call,*  
*I can't take the heartache,*
*of hearing of you with her again"*

"Thought it didn't matter who was with who"  
*"I trusted it'd be **ANYONE** but you"*

It started with the concrete fires,  
and it can end with Tunisian ash.

آتش و ال کالی
