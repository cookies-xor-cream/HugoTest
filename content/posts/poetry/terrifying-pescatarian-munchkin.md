The fish and chips were stale ingested,  
a finch beak sunders to a solar width,  
and demands fish gone, half digested,  
it screamed and it wailed but it never bit.

And bit by bit my stomach turned,  
birds scare me but this one wore  
its mouth in place of its money,  
and the lack thereof the fish and chips,

Wws the reason that its heart was torn.
