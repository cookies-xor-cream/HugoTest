I'm sat by the shore,  
in the side that you fell.

You wished with a noose,  
so I saw to it well.

And you slipped out your body,  
I saw as you slipped.

But you dared to deny me,  
as I reached for a sip.

I can hear it all dripping,  
as it *'knocks'* I suppose.

It came for the throne,  
with the old king deposed.

And if you might live,  
I can see to that too.

Aim not for your head,  
but aim to shoot through.

And if you might come rise,  
with a flood of the drowned.

Then take me right now,  
I'm ripe for the crown.

Please come with my dreams,  
we'll be lost in our fate.

Well throw out the key,  
as we're locking the gate.

As I'm writing the rest,  
I find my pen skip.

To the waterlogged step,  
of this man as he trips.

In a double entendre,  
and in double the sense.

Come here forthwith,  
we can sit as we pense.

I stranded myself,  
but you chose to be here.

You stranded yourself,  
and you chose me my dear.
