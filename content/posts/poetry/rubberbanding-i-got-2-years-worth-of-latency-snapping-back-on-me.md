Returning the favour is a 4 year round trip.

Have you ever seen the world buffering?  
I think you can tell by the breaks in the spinning,  
that send you tangent to the earth,  
but each stop is infinitesimal, so to the point and curt.

Every frame that the earth is dropping,  
is written into my journal and your diaries,  
for the edgecase where we might need  
a logbook for the data recovery.

I'd pull the curtains on the universe,  
but I'm waiting for an opus magnum,  
to top the 60 thousand words we wrote,  
and the 60 thousand we found lacking.

Between the two of us and an quarter ounce,  
we got through 5k before morning broke,  
now they sit in her bedside drawer,  
filled with the annotations that she wrote.

I think she thinks that she's the subject,  
and she's not completely wrong, it is about her,  
but that wasn't a conscious decision,  
it was the geyser our superliminal allowed to fissure.

Sometimes the latency feels too much,  
a quarter of a second to feel each touch,  
I think without you we fell out of sync,  
like I missed a fucking year in a single blink.

But I've lost greater time in far worse decisions,  
of note was the poison found in my prescription,  
and the bloodloss that took two years to uncover,  
but I'm sure as hell there have been others.

I saw your friend, or your ex, I suppose,  
she said she'd never seen me so god damn composed,  
I asked her why all of the jealousy,  
and hated what she had to say to me.

"When I said we broke up because of you,  
that wasn't conjecture, it had documented proof,  
I made her pick between me and you,  
but I misjudged what she would choose".

I replied that I had the same dilemma,  
but I cleaned the blackboards, erased the lemmas,  
I painted every surrender flag with neon green,  
to pretend crimson was a colour that I'd never seen.

If I could go back, I would wipe the slate,  
I wouldn't leave my sensibilities till so fucking late,  
not because that's how it should've been,  
but solely for the cause that she did the same for me.
