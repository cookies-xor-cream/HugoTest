Lain stitched into the faintest beating  
of a hyperinflated heartrate seething.

It's been a drag of a day, but that's half okay,  
I made it with friends, and that feels good to say.

It cut the thinking, and cut the running,  
of the stream across my face.

Of the red that meant to find my nose,  
but found itself downwardly displaced,  
and gravity-disposed.

My vision chose to split in twine,  
I'm lots of things, I just hope that  
one of them is fine.
