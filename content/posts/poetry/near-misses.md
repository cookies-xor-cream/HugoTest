My trousers carry the slit like a scar,  
in reminder of a grounding in the parking lot,  
falling flat, floored besides her car,  
I was bleeding through but guess they didn't notice it,  
I should've taken it as a sign,  
but my brain's disassembled itself,  
and I'm missing some important parts and bits.

I saw a friend alone tonight,  
felt less empty than I would otherwise,  
like I finally got something right.  
I told him I'll jump into his porsche,  
but in the irony, I found oncoming traffic,  
didn't notice it,  
till a girl I knew came and pulled me out.  
I should've taken it as a sign,  
to wipe an expression far too placid,  
and a little bit too proud.

Then she asked if she could pose a question,  
I told her that now, I wasn't on the clock,  
but her question was "can I buy you a drink",  
and god I have all the time,  
but I hardly want to sit and talk tonight.

She remembered my name from a stray email,  
she received five weeks ago,  
probably sitting stale in her unread.  
We debated the ethics,  
but forgot my utter lack of desire,  
I find it hard to fall for people,  
but I'm trying to fan that fire higher.

I saw another friend earlier today,  
In a discussion about confrontation,  
Whether any pair of people are better off at bay,  
And god there's so much that I want to,  
But I know I shouldn't say.

We ran into another yet,  
And at first he waved to me,  
And as much as I'd like to stay,  
And see,  
I had an appointment with the  
Nightmare and a dream.
