The last we saw of her that night,  
was the nurses working overtime,  
shooting me their side-eyed stared,  
as they were pulling out the glass

There was a bottle on the ground,  
that was shattered long before,  
and the splinters stuck around,  
just waiting for the gore.

There were three of them,  
and two of you, one of which partook,  
because she was the only one,  
they wouldn't let off of the hook.

They beat your ribcage in,  
they rolled you in the glass,  
the only pain you vocalised,  
was the sassy cawing of a casket-looking laugh.

And I stood there as I watched,  
I tried to reason it all out,  
tried to figure out what in the fuck,  
the violence was about.

"Remember from before...?"  
*"Don't speak for me,*  
*you're coughing blood,*  
*Kath? what is this all for?"*

But she didn't take a break,  
from the rib-pressed words,  
as she conferred,  
that she'd be finishing this verse:  
"Katherine just let me answer".

"Remember the parrot that I met,  
when I lost track of my old date.  
The pretty one, I caught within my net,  
Well her boyfriend wasn't calm"

"He was the protagonist to a beat-em-up,  
in which it looks like I might've got caught"

The emergency room limp-walk,  
was the most awkward one we've took,  
and neither of us talked,  
but we would trade and barter looks.

She did this way too much,  
I'm just happy this transpired,  
her age limit of twenty-three,  
on this kind of shit was due to  
have expired.
